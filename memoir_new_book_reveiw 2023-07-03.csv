2023-07-03,Pageboy,,Elliot Page,4.02,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'Audiobook', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir']",Buy on Amazon,booksandzoe,Rating 3 out of 5,"June 9, 2023","PAGEBOY was my most hotly anticipated book of the year. As a huge Elliot Page fan, I've been so excited to read this book since the first announcement, but I left feeling a bit... bereft and disappointed. I want to write this review with the utmost care, as obviously the state of trans rights is absolutely devastating right now, but I also want to review the book fairly, as I would any other. No doubt I will be coming back to this review to edit and rework, as I'm still processing the book in its entirety, but I'm going to stick with my initial thoughts here.                                      It feels odd to rate memoirs, as it feels inherently like rating the details of one's life as they lay them out so nakedly, so I want to be clear when rating and evaluating this book, in no way am I rating the actual content (stories/experiences) Page is recounting here, but rather just the way they are told narratively.                                      I've seen many reviews touch on this already, but the structure of the book is very non-cohesive. I don't so much have an issue with non-linear narratives, but the purpose of such a narrative choice is deliberate, to group like stories together to craft a narrative punch. The ways in which Page jumps back and forth between past and present rarely feel cohesive, or on any kind of theme, which ultimately lacks that punch, instead feeling a bit confusing and all over the place.                                      My other complaint is the way that Page leaves the majority of the stories he tells within the pages feeling unfinished, half-baked. The most powerful part of memoir, in my opinion, is the deeper level of thinking the author performs for the reader, building the connection of experience and self throughout the pages to let the reader feel completely ""in"" on the significance of the memories. While Page tells stories that are very impactful and interesting, there are many times where I just wanted more link to the significances of the stories, however they were often left unspoken and left to the interpretation of the reader. Including these would have also likely fixed the first problem of the lack of cohesion by interrogating the significances of each story and how they relate to each other to build the larger narrative.                                      My personal assumption is that Page didn’t know exactly what story he set to tell by writing this book, which explains the lack of cohesion, theme, and overall narrative pull. I think some of the stories could be removed, and others added, to create a memoir that feels more complete, and a stronger editing hand would’ve definitely been extremely helpful in that process.                                      Still, as an aforementioned huge fan of Elliot, I appreciated the deeper look into his life and experiences as a trailblazer both in publicly identifying as a lesbian for a long time in the public eye, and later as a trans man. I loved being able to see into his mind through stories both from his personal, family life and Hollywood, and definitely still found great value in many of the stories told, even if I ultimately wanted more from the structure and depth.","271 pages                             First published June 6, 2023","Pageboy                              is a groundbreaking coming-of-age memoir from the Academy Award-nominated actor Elliot Page.

2023-07-03,Pageboy,,Elliot Page,4.02,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'Audiobook', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir']",Buy on Amazon,Nin,Rating 1 out of 5,"June 10, 2023","I always feel so weird giving someone's memoir a 'star rating', particularly if it is someone I like or someone who's had a pretty rough time of it. Elliot Page is both those things, and I was really looking forward to this, read it in a day and felt really disappointed.                                      The first issue I had was that this is a non linear narrative, which works well with other writing styles and memoirs (hello Maggie Nelson - EP also apparently a fan, excellent taste). I strongly felt it didn't start working for 'Pageboy' until 60% + of the way through. I would imagine if I listened to this rather than reading it, I would've had to rewind several times. Chapters, especially in the first half, aren't really grouped thematically, you constantly jump from age 7 to 22 to 30 to now to 12, events linked with apparently no or little through line. This improves as the book goes on, but I felt a really good editor would've been helpful.                                      The next issue I had is the rather stunning lack of introspection. There are so many fairly colossal incidents detailed - sexual assaults after sexual assaults, homophobic incidents, violence threatened again and again in a continual stream of one two punches, their magnitude horrifying but all too familiar to those of us who have experienced such similar circumstances as a result of our gender or sexuality. I do not wish to make Elliot ruminate on such things, but to include them, and include no introspective discussion afterwards when the events are so frequent, does a disservice in a sense to the narrative... I didn't come away from this feeling I knew Page any better as a person, just that I know more things that have happened to him, like a NSFW and devastatingly sad Wikipedia entry.                                      The lack of introspection I found most surprising was that there was no discussion whatsoever of breaking the gender binary of clothing and stereotypes - indeed, Page's conclusion of female children being stuffed into feminine clothing they hate was 'I hated it, because I was a boy', there is nothing that scratches beneath the surface of 'skirts for girls, trousers for boys' from Page's POV, which felt disappointing as someone who is such an icon for gender non conformity and LGBT rights.                                      As a lesbian, and as most lesbians I’ve come across have experienced, we all hated being stuffed into feminine clothes and having our Batman costumes tutted at, and loathed being called girly names and 'pretty'. Other trans memoirs I have read dive into the feelings and emotions behind the stereotypes of clothing and gendered language into something that is sometimes more ethereal and intangible, almost a phenomenological study into the self. Of course, Page not putting pen to paper and including this doesn't negate his identity, experiences or feelings, but it does just leave an extremely shallow view of trans identity being around clothes, stereotypes and 'hating being perceived as a lesbian'.                                      In fact, towards the very end of the memoir Page lets this very question dangle in mid air before never answering or resolving it. I cannot stress how much homophobia there is in this memoir. To be honest, I've been spat at, assaulted, shouted at, and feel fairly robust in being able to deal with it and talk about it but hell, reading EP's experiences really effected me and I had to put it down a few times. Only the last 9% of the book is about physical transition, so the vast, vast majority of the narrative is around being a closeted 'lesbian' (using Page's own words to describe), being an out 'lesbian' and being metaphorically kicked up and down the societal corridors for it. To include the part about people judging his trans identity as a reaction to homophobia and then just never mention it again after reams and reams of homophobia, is to dangle a question that it seems Page didn't want to answer for whatever reason. Again it is up to him what to include, but by the end there were so many loose threads, with such comparatively little discussion as to what caused the identity shift and acceptance from 'out' lesbianism to - presumably - heterosexual trans man was quite startling.                                      Another dropped thread is the revelations of Page’s eating disorder, which is quite a large and impactful part of the middle section, and then promptly disappears, further unanswered dangling questions. People have expressed recent concern for Elliot’s weight, which I know public speculation is cruel and unhelpful, so I would’ve thought this would’ve been a chance to comment or resolve, but it turns into another half baked thread abandoned in the mess of the non linear “and then, but before, and now, and then” narrative.                                      Again, other trans memoirs I have read discuss the convergence of 'crossing over' from being seen as a lesbian or gay man, to public assimilation into heterosexuality by virtue of their gender identity. I've read quite a few books by transmen who were formally lesbians who discussed how difficult they found this aspect of their transitions - feeling like heterosexual dynamics didn't quite suit them, feeling of losing a community, feeling like they were joining an oppressor class (male) and sometimes feelings of guilt for this. Again nothing, zero, zilch. There are only two mentions of romantic life post transition - one where Elliot is so full of self loathing it breaks my heart, saying he is meeting a girl from the internet for a date, and he wonders if she is only meeting him as 'a joke' because of his transition. The other is with highly sexualised language (go for it pal), in which Page refers to his natal genitals as his 'pussy' and liking being 'fucked' in his pussy. I hope people realise that not all trans men like that kinda language (obviously EP can like what he likes!).                                      Some memoirs I feel I 'know' the people they're discussing, the primary and secondary characters in their lives - Viola Davis's recent memoir and Maggie Nelson again come to mind - such is the power of their communicative writing. Everyone around Page felt frustratingly one dimensional, including his mother, whose backstory would've been contextually helpful to know at the beginning, but instead was given around 70% of the way through?                                      I was a big fan of Juno as a teenager, but a bigger fan of Gaycation. To my disappointment, that incredibly important series was mentioned I believe only one time, when Page talked to a trans woman about her identity and she affirmed his. I feel that this was an incredibly wasted opportunity - Page got to travel the world and meet some of the most interesting LGBT people living in the most diverse political and cultural landscapes. To have even a bit of discussion of the toll this must've taken on him, meeting people whose parents hated them, who lived in huts in mountains to escape homophobia, who were beaten in streets by police, I feel would've made me feel I knew Page a bit more off camera.                                      Considering Page's role as - at one time - the most famous Millennial lesbian, I was a bit disappointed that there was so much unending homophobia (which, trust me, I know is also true of life!), but then Page's marriage to Emma was only mentioned in past tense ('my ex spouse'). I suppose this may be to protect Emma's privacy which I understand, but to not have even a moment of beauty in the progress of marriage equality and Elliot's privilege in being able to receive it at a time when only roughly 30/190 countries worldwide had advanced to marriage equality is a shame.                                      The memoir ends very abruptly with a sort of 'top surgery and all was well' angle, but again I would be interested to know why EP chose top surgery before testosterone, which is fairly unusual practice with trans men's medical treatment in the US. Give me something but tales of homophobia EP, I beg of you! There was so little discussion of transition, of the potential fears, pitfalls, the new fangled joy, that I was very surprised when I hit the 'Acknowledgements' section. I feel this could've been an excellent book in a few years time, but it felt so rushed and jumbled. I'm sure it would've been planned for pride month release purposefully, but even just a few more months, or a longer book (love me a long memoir), could've been brilliant. So much potential, and there are some really nice bits of poetic prose, but ultimately squandered.                                      Also, I hope Kate Mara gave permission for those very.. intimate.. details! Ahem.

From growing up knowing that they identified more as male, but having to suppress that side of themselves as they became a famous actor. To having to hide their sexuality from the public before they bravely came out as gay in 2014. Then as a trans man in late 2020. Elliot uses he/they pronouns.                                       4 stars                                      from me because narratively, it doesn’t flow as cohesively as it should when jumping from the past to the present day. It is his story to tell, and I respect Elliot immensely, but I would have rather read his experiences growing up more linear. I see a lot of others agreeing here. More editing to shuffle around these chapters would have really helped here. If this has been down, I easily could have rated it higher.

I had already purchased it months before it was out. Yesterday, I listened to the whole book on Audible. Well, yuck. The book was a confusing mix of time periods in Elliot's life. It was obvious what was from his childhood, but the material from his adulthood was totally confusing. I couldn't tell when what circumstance he was talking about occurred. Was it before the last one? After the one before that? I think a timeline would be necessary to figure out this jumble of stories. Also, he threw out first names of famous people as if I ought to know the person by their first name only. Well, maybe I'm too old, but who the heck are these people? Why should I care? Finally, Page's writing style was very stylized. I don't know if that's how he actually thinks or if he was just trying too hard to sound interesting and intellectual. Now, to be truthful on my part, I gave Page an extra star because he tried to explain the trans experience; although, he didn't do a very good job.

That story is never less than interesting and thought-provoking, and Page CAN write ... but there were a few issues.                                      As many have pointed out, the author eschews a linear retelling of his life, in favor of bouncing around in time and attempting to tie things together thematically, or just as it occurs to him. Had I not just finished Andrew Rannells' new book right beforehand, which uses a similar template, that probably would have irked me more. But it IS sometimes difficult to tell just where you are timewise, especially as the actor rarely pinpoints such tales with what he is working on at the time, which might have provided welcome signposts to where in his life/career we are.                                      At least one story from early on in the book is retold almost verbatim in the final chapters, the editor not catching it, or perhaps Page just wanting to reiterate it. And ofttimes, stories seem to dangle unresolved, or lead nowhere. Also, his partners are especially hard to keep track of, as they come and go with great frequency [NB: that isn't intended to be 'slut-shaming' - Page probably had far fewer partners than I did at his age - it's just difficult to keep them all ... ummm ... straight!].                                      Speaking of his career, frustratingly little insight is given into his work, and what there is seems kind of formulaic - i.e., 'I made this with so and so and either enjoyed it or didn't'. I'm not such a huge fan that I have seen everything he's done on film/TV, but there are some really odd omissions - most egregiously he never once mentions 'Freeheld', the brilliant and intense lesbian true story he both produced and starred in with Julianne Moore, which I would think would have been a highlight. And the audition process for 'Juno' is lined out - but not the actual making of the film ... and his trip to the Academy Awards for it is dispatched in a few sentences, focusing more on what they made him wear than anything else.                                      For the most part, the prose is always at least competent, and ofttimes quite stirring; at other times, he reaches for something more poetic or flowery, and it lands with a clunk. But again, the story he wanted to tell is heartbreaking, and his anguish at coming to terms with his true self and owning that is both inspiring and admirable.

His work in movies like Hard Candy or An American Crime couldn't be more heartfelt and outstanding and Viktor Hargreeves is my favorite character in The umbrella academy (yep, I've binge watched the entire show).                                      I also applaud his passionate activism for the human rights of the LGBTQ+ community, and I highly recommend his documentary Gaycation, particularly when he confronts the appalling bigotry of Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro, exposing the nauseatingly homophobic views that our society still upholds. Page's unique perspective as a trans Hollywood actor who doesn't shy away from advocating for the less visible lives of other LGBTQ+ folks is a rather important one and I'm looking forward to learning more about him as a person. He's always struck me as an incredibly authentic and fascinating individual.                                      This book will be released in a month, exactly, and I'm counting the days to read it. I can't wait!                                      _________________________________                                       Update on Jun 08, 2023                                      A sensitive, beautifully written and necessary account, especially for trans and queer people who would like to see their own experiences reflected and validated in empowering stories like this one. Needless to say, an unmissable read for those who simply admire Elliot Page’s extraordinary artistic talents and meaningful acting career.                                      I can tell an autobiography is worth remembering when I notice the author couldn’t be bothered to camouflage his own imperfections or to manufacture a pristine version of themselves. In this brief memoir, Elliot Page talks genuinely about the mistakes he's made in previous interactions and intimate relationships, reflecting about the ways in which his insecurities have sometimes led to rather negative outcomes. He admits to failings like jealousy and selfishness, as well as a tendency to avoid any conflicts or complex conversations, bottling up his feelings and shutting down instead of trying communicate his needs and expectations. Page also recognizes his privileges and recollects resorting to self-righteousness as a way of assuaging the guilt he feels for benefitting from a system where our comfort and consumerism come at the cost of human lives being neglected and entire ecosystems collapsing. Throughout the book however, a desire to learn and improve remains and the portrait of a compassionate soul emerges amidst the flaws that make him so real and so similar to us.                                      Voluntarily distancing himself from the pedestal we usually assign to the most talented actors of our time, Page recounts troubles and pains that many still believe to be incompatible with affluent and famous lives, and his narrative is nothing short of heartbreaking at some points. We rarely think that our ordinary experiences with loneliness, low self-esteem, depression and even bullying can also severely affect our favorite actors, but in reality fame often exposes young artists to a myriad of vultures, removing the necessary shield of privacy at a rather vulnerable age and, in certain circumstances, intensifying the pangs of their disillusionment. Page isn't afraid to take a stance against the culture of abuse that continues to go unpunished in Hollywood, calling attention to an evil that still lurks underneath the glamour of red carpets, box-office successes and glistening statuettes. The emotional burden of acting in heart-wrenching movies that depict beyond brutal realities, like                                       An American Crime,                                      is also discussed here, as well as the actor’s struggles with an eating disorder that was further amplified by his gender dysphoria.                                      I've always enjoyed vaguer and more subtle stories, as they’re a fertile soil where our imagination can flourish, but I also appreciate the intimate, authentic and sensitive way in which the author narrates the intricacies of his life, particularly when he describes his feelings of inadequacy about his sexuality and gender identity. It was deeply moving reading about the erosive and silent shame he endured during his formative years, a shame that so many LGBTQ+ individuals around the world experience anonymously every day. It takes courage to break free from the restrictive standards imposed by a society that claims to uphold equality while still rewarding so many purveyors of discrimination and transphobia, sweeping hate crimes under the rug as if the lives of those who stray from the norms had never truly mattered. I’m hailing from a country with the                                       largest number or murdered trans and queer people in the world                                      and it brings me hope to see someone as famous as Elliot Page trying to help shift this sad paradigm.                                      At last, I’m glad the person he's always been could finally find a home in his own body, as he now exudes the graceful confidence of those who managed to emerge victorious from the battle against the inclement waters of self-hate. Books like Pageboy are essential for building a world where, one day, all trans and queer people will also feel safe and beloved and empowered enough to declare:                                        I’m fully who I am.

I thought some of his writing on a sentence level was really great but the unchronological and disconnected vignette style got a little repetitive about half way through, and I think that's because a lot of the chapters are rehashing truly terrible homophobic shit that happened to them (tbh, that stuff was hard to read as a queer person!) but without any introspection or value added to what was otherwise a retelling of a horrible event. Because there (deliberately) isn't an overall narrative arc, I think the individual pieces needed something to elevate and add significance to them, and more often than not they didn't have that.                                      The strongest vignettes are about Page's childhood and youth, I suspect because he has enough distance and ability to reflect on them, which he might not have on his life in his 20s and 30s. I loved the details of Halifax and Nova Scotia and how he brought in some history like the Halifax explosion. Page's audiobook narration was also fantastic. I'm glad we have this book, but I can't help but feel Elliot Page wrote it a bit before he was ready.

Hear me out - I do not want to rate anyone’s memoir a one star. Especially someone who’s had a journey like Elliot’s. But holy wow this book was TERRIBLE. I was looking forward to this for the last 6+ months.                                      what even is it….? A stream of consciousness? Stories? Poems? A memoir? Notes from a journal? How horrible - he doesn’t get vulnerable, doesn’t use his platform to advocate, and WHAT THE HECK IS ALL THAT TEA ABOUT KATE MARA?! It’s the only legitimate writing, but too bad it’s so graphic - all for nothing really. Just to brag about Kate…? He doesn’t even thank her in his acknowledgments….this felt like a really privileged white male thinking he’s important. It felt so deeply disrespectful the way he talked about Kate. Skip it - DNF. For queer readers like myself - do not expect any deep dives, any relatable experience, or honestly, anything we’d want representing the majority of our stories. Elliot likes the sound of his own voice in this book is the vibe I got. Nothing worthwhile to share or read - if he wasn’t famous, this book probably wouldn’t exist. Those slamming down five stars just because this is EP, are helping to silence more important queer memoirs that aren’t being elevated (especially during pride month) because of Elliot’s PR push.                                      The lack of any linear or planned storyline is noticeable. It feels rushed, it feels like he felt people wanted to hear his story - yet he’s wildly protective of it - and honestly? It flopped. Pride month money run…? Feels like it. Could have benefited from several rounds of editing, a bit more introspection, and a lot more thoughtful storytelling. I’m leaving liking Elliot less which was not the plan considering I’m obsessed with his work.

It will not get you all tingly with stuff it feels like maybe you shouldn't know, and you will end the book not knowing who several of the main players are, because Elliot values privacy and is a good person. This book is first and foremost the story of Elliot coming to terms with his gender identity and transness amid a world that devalues and dismisses it, and the mental toll that took on him and his relationships. What you will get is a deep look into the psyche of someone who always seemed fine on the surface, but who was in a really dark place where it really mattered. Elliot is sad and serious as a narrator, though a talented writer (like Jennette McCurdy, he absolutely didn't need a ghostwriter).                                      The audiobook is a good one, though I do recommend speeding up the narration if you normally don't, as he speaks pretty slowly.

My only real issue with the book is that I wish it had been written more in chronological order. I had a genuinely difficult time at many points in the narrative trying to figure out where exactly we were in Elliot's timeline, and this also made it feel like many of the chapters weren't as tightly structured as they could have been.                                      But really, that complaint is peanuts. This is a good memoir, and a book worth reading, especially right now as trans civil rights are actively in danger.

Then he came out as trans and it all made sense! That was around about the same time I started my own transition, so I definitely felt a connection there too. We were similar ages, going through a similar thing at a similar time. It's been fun following his Instagram and watching him coming into his own over the past couple of years, and I was very excited when he announced he was releasing this book!                                      There was a lot here I found interesting and relatable - his descriptions of gender dysphoria throughout his life, that sense that there's something wrong but you can't quite figure out what. Nothing will be able to change how desperately alone I felt as a child, but it does offer some comfort now to know that there were other people going through similar things. There's also a lot here about how he felt he had to keep his sexuality hidden. A lot of weighty topics are dealt with - including homophobia, sexual abuse, and eating disorders. Yet a lot of it is just talked about in passing and isn't really reflected on to any great degree. I felt that was a missed opportunity, especially given that what sets this book apart is that it's a trans person's memoir. I know from my own experience that being trans - even if you haven't yet realised that's what you are - impacts upon how you experience and react to things that happen to you, and I wish this book had provided more of that perspective.                                      I also wish he'd written more about his transition, and what it's been like navigating that in public. The book ends just after he gets top surgery, and although he mentions having been on testosterone for a year, he doesn't really talk about his experiences since. For instance, he came out while starring in a tv show - I'm not sure if anyone else has done that, so it felt like an opportunity was missed to add a unique perspective on navigating Hollywood as a newly-out trans person.                                      The book takes a non-linear structure, jumping around in an often confusing way. He also often tries to be too poetic and flowery in his writing style. I don't think he's untalented as a writer, but probably needs more practice before really being able to pull off what he was going for here. Tighter editing could've helped.                                      I definitely think this is an important book, and worth reading if you're trans or want to understand our experiences a little better - especially given that transmasculine voices so often go unheard. Props to Elliot for all he's doing - it must be incredibly difficult. However, part of me wonders if he didn't rush to put this book out while his coming out was still relatively recent. I'd actually really like to see him release another one in a few years so he can go more in-depth about how it is to be an out trans guy in the public eye.","271 pages                             First published June 6, 2023","Pageboy                              is a groundbreaking coming-of-age memoir from the Academy Award-nominated actor Elliot Page.

This is an incredibly powerful book that explores Elliot Page’s highs and lows, w a level of intimacy that resonated w me deeply. While I find celebrity memoirs often struggle to connect w a broad and everyday audience, Page has easily defied this by presenting a personal story that not only captivates yr average reader (like me) but also offers a relatable and thought-provoking narrative. It sheds light on Page's experiences as a queer and trans person, allowing us readers, and of course those of us within the trans community in particular, to find a mirror reflecting our own lives. Page’s heartfelt and vulnerable reflections on gender, love, mental health, relationships, etc etc, strike a chord, evoking in me a really strong sense of empathy and understanding. The writing in ‘Pageboy’ is reminiscent (to me at least) of author Ivan Coyote, but stands on its own as it effortlessly draws us into Page’s story. The way he speaks of home and the longing fr a familiar place where one can properly belong creates an incredibly relatable atmosphere, allowing me (and I assume many others) to form an immediate connection w them. As well, their candid exploration of the abuse they went through as a young person new to Hollywood and stardom adds a layer of depth and authenticity to the memoir. His courage in confronting these challenging aspects of his life is both commendable and inspiring. By sharing their experiences, Page not only raises awareness but also opens up space fr important conversations about topics often shrouded in silence. This is a book that demands to be read and heard. Its universal themes and Page's sincere introspection make it a truly powerful reading experience. ‘Pageboy’ is not just a glimpse into the life of a celebrity; it‘a rather an invitation to embark on a journey of self-discovery and acceptance. Elliot Page's story will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on those of us who have ever felt marginalised or misunderstood, but know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel fr us.","271 pages                             First published June 6, 2023","Pageboy                              is a groundbreaking coming-of-age memoir from the Academy Award-nominated actor Elliot Page.

He repeatedly described the bullying and microaggressions that came from being a member of his family, a child celebrity, and an actor who wanted to continue his work – and the stalking, hiding, and gossip that comes from being a celebrity (                                       Juno                                      and                                       Umbrella Academy                                      are the works I know best).                                      Life is difficult, even for people with significant privilege. Page admittedly had significant privilege; yet, was seen and disparaged for these aspects of his life, often in ways that went under the radar, that were often a form of gaslighting: ""I think I’m gay.""... ""No you’re not"" (p. 80).                                      Pretending, living a double life, is also a problem. As Kurt Vonnegut said, ""We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be."" In acting, Page often had to be a different person, yet pretending who he was at his essence undermined him at his core. He often restricted his food intake, self-injured, engaged in more minor numbing and dissociation, and was suicidal.                                      ""Imagine the most uncomfortable, mortifying thing you could wear. You squirm in your skin. It’s tight, you want to peel it from your body, tear it off, but you can’t. Day in and day out. And if people are to learn what is underneath, who you are without that pain, the shame would come flooding out, too much to hold. The voice was right,                                       you deserve the humiliation. You are an abomination. You are too emotional. You’re not real                                      ."" (p. 195)                                      Will all of this change now that Page has transitioned? I hope so. Longitudinal research on gender transitioning is promising. It is clear that people often experience self-loathing and gender dysphoria pre-transition. Teens offered gender-affirming care tend to experience less anxiety and depression – especially those with strong family support. Adults struggle more – for all sorts of reasons.                                      I look forward to Page's next memoir.","271 pages                             First published June 6, 2023","Pageboy                              is a groundbreaking coming-of-age memoir from the Academy Award-nominated actor Elliot Page.

Page came out as a transgender man in 2020, and has since gone on to flourish in his comfort and authenticity. But this memoir isn’t so much about his transition as it is about the life that led him there.

Elliot Page can write, and he's relentless in the pursuit of understanding both himself and others.                                      There's plenty here about various romances and crushes and one gets the impression that Elliot is a person in love with being in love. There is quite a bit of kissing and telling, but it seems only with the permission of the parties involved.                                      As for the the sexist, creepy, behavior of various people in Hollywood, the more that comes out about the victimization of children and young people in the movie/TV business, the more I question anyone's willingness to to have their child involved in acting.                                      I do wish there had been more about his acting process and the different films he's made, but otherwise informative as regards what it's like to work and live in Hollywood.                                      It must be said that Elliot's dad and stepmother Linda are both garbage. Linda was so jealous and spiteful that she couldn't bear to see her husband show affection to, or an interest in, his own child. To appease Linda, and prevent her angry outbursts towards him, this manipulative trash dad allowed Linda to torment and bully his kid, all while ignoring Elliot and treating him with coldness. And anti-trans dad has no regrets apparently. As for Linda, she has plenty of excuses but no real remorse. No wonder Elliot has trust issues.

I've had a number of animals pass through my life thus far (albeit mostly cats, with a few dogs and fish sprinkled in), so this was a book I badly wanted to love and through what I read, there were sentences and sentiments that had me nodding my head and muttering to myself about how much I related. The self-blame and guilt when a rescue doesn't go right, the retroactive second guessing where you walk back through your decisions to figure out what went wrong, the sense of purpose that comes from having something depend on you - all (and more) covered here.                                      Seeing similar experiences to the ones I've had reflected back drew me more into the story of George, who is a charming entity unto himself and whose personality develops almost as quickly as his body. I enjoyed learning more about taking care of birds and seeing the author throw all of herself into getting this helpless creature, abandoned during a mighty wind storm that killed his siblings, where he needed to be. You can feel her empathy and warmth as her affection for George grows and it's easy to not only root for his progress but see in him animals in your past that you loved. The drawings sprinkled throughout the book definitely help in that regard, too.                                      However, George: A Magpie Memoir is unusual in that it's based on real diary entries that've been retroactively fleshed out, which is a structural and narrative decision that kept me from really sinking my teeth into it. While I understood the reasoning behind the diary conceit, particularly given how quickly George (mentally and physically) grows and how big a role he plays in the author's life, I was surprised to see that this isn't solely a book about taking care of George. Rather,                                      the structure means there's a lot of content here that feels tangential, ranging from information about the author's garden, how she's renovating her home, her childhood (especially her relationship with her father), her writing career, etc. Which I guess does provide some context re: how George is fitting into her life and where she was emotionally/psychologically when he came around, but it made things feel a little unfocused. Combine that with sometimes dry prose, retroactive additions/editing that take you out of the book's world (e.g. referring to her then-partner, who wasn't remotely interested in George, solely as The Ex), and a concept predicated on internality and it was akin to a long, (mostly) unstructured monologue.                                      This is probably just a me thing, but I also wasn't a big fan of the way the book was organized. It's hard to get into diary-reading mode when entries aren't separated onto different pages and there's no real chapter-like organization to how they're laid out. Maybe I'm just too out of practice when it comes to reading non-fiction, but rhythm is a big thing for me when I read and here I just couldn't find anything, hence the DNF. Figuring out some way of better organizing the author's thoughts could've opened the story up more while retaining the concept.                                      I feel like had this been narrative non-fiction, I would've enjoyed it more. The structure would've been more accessible, the narrative would've been tighter and more cohesive, and the emotion would've been stronger. This is one that I might put away for now and then give another try at a later date, but for now, I don't think I can recommend.

I received a copy of this book courtesy of a giveaway via Goodreads, Avid Reader Press, and Simon & Schuster. Thank you all!                                      Author Frieda Hughes takes readers on a madcap journey through raising and rehabilitating a wild bird in this nonfiction title that will add a dose of heartfelt slice-of-life whimsy to your summer reading list. Hughes is a well-established poet, columnist, children's book author, and painter with acclaim attached to all of her creative pursuits. Her artistic roots were fostered by her parents, Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes, but throughout her career Hughes has come to be a highly respected artist in her own right.                                      The memoir follows a period in Hughes' mid-forties wherein, after throwing herself into revamping the gardens of her fixer-upper home, she rescues a magpie chick flung from his nest by a storm. While his siblings perish, this bird not only survives, but makes a shrieking demand to be helped in thriving; Hughes, of course, christens him George and complies. What follows is a raucous journey of growth for both magpie and human as Hughes devotes herself to the increasingly clever and unique creature as he matures into a quirky fixture of the neighborhood (for better and, for some residents like Hughes' spouse at the time, worse.) George inspires Hughes long after his eventual departure from her own ""nest,"" pushing her to stand tall in what she truly wants to shape her life into, no matter the discomfort, droppings, or dissolution of connections that have been holding her back.                                      This book shines in its sheer earnestness: every moment Hughes spends documenting George is rife with the unique tenderness and wonder of a human-animal bond. The dynamic between George and Hughes' three dogs is also a treat to witness, and the little ""flock"" Hughes builds with them all is so heartwarming. Hughes' illustrations also pepper the book's short page count, and I would have loved to have seen even more sketches of the titular corvid throughout.                                      While George's story rightfully takes up most of the memoir, it cannot entirely prop itself up while the other elements of Hughes' life at this stage are left hanging. She refers to her spouse at the time as ""The Ex"" throughout, yet we only receive bits and pieces to suggest how impactful it is when their marriage dissolves after a long, quiet decline -- a decline we barely get to see unfold. I often wished Hughes made time to impart the gravity of her shift from city literati member to bird-rearing homebody, but her work as a writer and painter (while brought up constantly) almost become background noise compared to this isolated period of months. Hughes does spend a decent number of pages on her experiences with chronic fatigue syndrome, and there is the closest we get to seeing a fully represented self from her. The diary excerpt format of the memoir also holds it back somewhat, as many well-established facts about Hughes, The Ex, and George are repeated ad nauseum as though readers would forget between entries. A good restructuring and more fleshed-out emotional beats could have gone a long way in service of all the stories that must be told to truly capture Hughes and George.                                      With all that said, if you don't mind a scattershot narrative, George: A Magpie Memoir makes for a charming read.                                      -Library Assistant Jodi Hooper","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","“ He was a hectic, unprincipled bird, but it was impossible not to love him.” From poet and painter Frieda Hughes, a memoir of love, obsession , and feathers.

Growing up the child of a diffident father (Ted Hughes) and a secretly mentally tormented mother (Sylvia Plath), Hughes found rare comfort in nature. The joys of the outdoor world and the happiness of keeping pets even for short periods led her to wish for a truly permanent home. However, this was something that seemed to elude her as she lost her mother to suicide when she was still a toddler, attended 12 schools by age 13, and finally found a place to settle (in Wales) with a man she knew would never want to stay in one place --- a man she designates, with ironic humor, as The Ex.                                      With portions of her diary shared beginning in May 2007, Hughes recounts how a dying baby magpie saved her life. She found the creature, which she would name George, when a fierce storm drove his parents from her garden. Keeping, protecting, tolerating and even training George soon became her fixation. She kept him alive by feeding him giant worms and accepted the fact that the more he ate, the more he pooped --- on her clothing and all over the house.                                      As natural creatures tend to do, George adapted rather quickly to life in the Hughes home. He became Hughes’ friend when in general her life tended to be a bit lonely. The joys that George’s closeness brought were sometimes offset by The Ex’s somewhat distant attitudes, even as she, who cared so diligently for her winged wonderchild, knew he eventually would fly away --- as would The Ex. But her triumphant construction of an aviary seals the sense that she now firmly and surely has her lasting, nature-laden home.                                      Hughes’ connection to George, seen day by day, is neatly crafted to include her reflections on her private physical and psychological ups and downs, providing a rare view of a human mind and heart melding spiritually with instinctive, non-human creatures. She concludes by counting her blessings, knowing that the future could bring further pangs, but that all blows could be softened by new arrivals “to populate my kitchen and my aviary, becoming a source of joy and equilibrium when the going got tough --- all because of a little magpie called George.”                                      Enhanced with occasional poems and her penned line drawings of the birds whose praises she sings, Hughes’ saga is intelligent, amusing and poignant. It invites us to realize, as she did, that all birds must someday take to the skies --- while encouraging us to honor and assist them when we can.

When poet and artist Frieda Hughes found an injured magpie chick in her garden, she had no idea that he would change her life. She took him into her home and named him George, documenting his antics and recovery in her journal. She was quickly captivated by this little bird, who was full of curiosity, intelligence, and mischief.                                      I enjoy nature writing and anything with animals, but I was quite unprepared for the amount of delight that I would feel from George. Hughes’ writing is beautiful and compelling, as are her illustrations that are sprinkled through the book.                                      Inevitably, George and Hughes’ must part ways, as George is a wild animal who must be set free. This was incredibly emotionally, as Hughes’ has a dueling conflict of wanting him to stay, but knowing that he must go. She developed a deep bond with George. Her time with George also coincided with the decline of her marriage, adding to the tension.                                      The way Hughes interacts with George, and subsequently other animals in her care, including birds of prey, causes her to lose some friendships. Admittedly, I was quite surprised with how she casually lets the animals roam around her kitchen, especially since birds do not have the function of bladder control. It got messy! In a sense, she became the stereotype of the “crazy cat lady,” but with birds and many friends did not understand. On the flip side, as fellow animal lover, I can completely understand her devotion to those in her care and I can understand her ways of interacting with them.                                      George: A Magpie Memoir is lovely and a book that is sure to delight many animal lovers, especially those fond of birds. I highly recommend it! Also, in case you are wondering, Hughes’s is the daughter of Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath, but she makes it clear that she doesn't want her lineage to dominate the conversation. She is a very accomplished writer and artist in her own right.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","“ He was a hectic, unprincipled bird, but it was impossible not to love him.” From poet and painter Frieda Hughes, a memoir of love, obsession , and feathers.

I haven’t read anything by Freida Hughes before and knew her only for her famous parents, Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. While this may have been my first encounter with Freida Hughes’s writing, it will not be my last. I absolutely love her way with words. Whether she’s creating poetry, prose, or a painting, she is an artist, and such a good one at that. She’s so incredibly gifted with words. How do I know? Because I hate birds. 🙈 And if Hughes was not such a gifted writer, I think I would have chucked this book across the room because I could not even HANDLE all of the bird crap and the crazy bird antics, and the molting feathers, and more bird crap. 🤣 Yet, I absolutely could not stop reading. Hughes’s healing and restoration discussed in this “magpie memoir” were so compelling, and I was desperate to see how the memoir concluded.                                      With the exception of dogs, I’m just really not an animal person at all, and so I’ll admit that I am maybe not the target audience for this book. However, if you DO have an appreciation for birds specifically and/or the care of animals in general, you might really love this memoir. Honestly, even if you don’t, Hughes’s writing is so compelling and lovely that I would pick it up anyway. You know all those jokes about “I could read a grocery list by this author…” Well, I think maybe that’s how I feel about Freida Hughes now. 😂 Because I would (and did) read a book about a bird written by her.                                      Have you had a reading experience like this where you didn’t love the subject matter but loved the way the author told the story?

Every day, they brought beauty, laughter, and love into my life.                                      There is something special about bonding with an animal. My girls didn’t sit in our lap, they didn’t tolerate being held. Shibas are independent by nature, and having spent years in a cage, farm animals not pets, they had to learn to bond with humans—and each other. But they knew I loved them and took care of them and they sat at my feet, allowing me to reach down and pet them. And as they aged and grew blind, they relied on each.                                      Frieda Hughes loves animals. She had three dogs that slept on her when she took a nap. Then, a storm brought a baby magpie into her life, thrown from its nest and injured and dependent. She named it George.                                      Until he was grown, George bonded with Hughes and played with her dogs. He was trouble, stealing and hiding all kinds of food and objects, resisting the cage, and pooping everywhere. But he was fascinating to watch and entertaining, and she loved him.                                      The Ex, as she names him, wasn’t as pleased with her new charge. They had full plates as working artists and new homeowners of a handy-man special house in Wales. Plus, Hughes finally was creating her dream garden. In spite of her challenging health issues, she worked hard at her writing and gardening and home improvement. The Ex was unhappy, adding to Hughes stress. She provided their only income and when the newspaper cancelled her poetry column their art became their income.                                      Teenaged George was allowed to fly out the window into the greater world, and when he started to stay away overnight Hughes was conflicted, missing him and still happy he would have a normal magpie life.

I love magpies. They are so awesome. I know they are right jerks, but where I live they are not native, so when I go some place see one, it’s like seeing a special animal. So naturally when this was offered on Netgalley, I figured why not.                                      Hughes is the daughter of the famous Plath and the famous Ted Hughes, but in all honesty, she seems far, far, far more interesting than either of her parents. Maybe its because she owns a snake or the motorcycles or her brutally honest story of her relationship with George.                                      Despite the title and some of the action, the book is more of how Hughes feel in love with rescuing and caring for birds than a straight biography of a bird. Hughes is brutally honest about the amount of work that goes into tending to a baby bird as well as the amount bird poo she had to clean up. The book also examines, somewhat, the break down in her marriage at the time, and her eventually return to self.                                      What comes across clearly is her love, her absolute love, for George and for her garden. It makes that at times a little repetitive a joy to read. She details not only George’s learning to fly and coping with bunch of dogs, but her building her garden and, eventually, her taking in other birds. It does make you want to visit her garden.                                      Additionally, the sketches of George are wonderful.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","“ He was a hectic, unprincipled bird, but it was impossible not to love him.” From poet and painter Frieda Hughes, a memoir of love, obsession , and feathers.

I didn't realise the author was the daughter of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes until I began to read it. Her background adds an extra dash of story to that of her time with the magpie George, and I liked how Hughes scattered memories from her childhood and insights into her inner life and failing marriage throughout the narrative - while keeping the focus on George.                                      I smiled often, and I loved the drawings of George by Hughes which were included in the book (they also didn't slow my e-reader down, which is another plus - an issue with some ebooks with drawings in them). There's even a few poems from the author.                                      I'm still not entirely sure, having finished the book, why Hughes began to build an aviary with the idea of keeping George captive forever (though I am someone raised on the story of Born Free). Still, it has turned out to be a practical decision, as the reader discovers in the epilogue - though I wish the epilogue hadn't felt so rushed!

Magpies are my favourite bird species. As part of the corvid family, they are sociable and highly intelligent birds. I have two resident Magpie birds who are paired close by nicknamed Hoppy (he has a slight limp) and Hippy and I could spend all day watching their antics as they smuggle anything shiny or precious amongst the plants in the garden or chatter wildly to each other. A complete joy to behold.                                      It is when Frieda Hughes moves to the Welsh countryside, having finally found the house in which she will set her roots in, the house which will become ""the home"" when after a particularly nasty storm she encounters a Magpie chick in need of recuperation. This little bundle of feathers, swiftly nicknamed George, would go on to have great significance and change life completely for Hughes, be it better or worse.                                      This memoir is deeply moving with a raw, personal style to it. At times it felt as though I was reading recollections similar to that as a diary entry. The narrative is unflinching and humourous as you read of George's mischievous behaviour and complications of living life with an energetic Magpie. I particularly enjoyed the tales of George engaging with his ""pack"", that is, his canine companions and how he would play tricks on them or tease them with the suggestion of food.                                      Interspersed with the chaotic upbringing of George is the complex personal situations that the author finds herself within. Juggling chronic illness, bereavement, and a troubled marriage, Hughes highlights the sheer comfort and beauty of nature that is truly irresistible to many. You grasp the importance of George's relationship with the author, his charming personality which was easy to love acting as a lifeline from the troubles of life. A feeling that many will be able to emphasise with.                                      George is a beautiful story, not only of the happiness in the moment but also of the hope and joy there can be ahead and I am truly glad that I read about this charming little bird.

Did Amelia Possanza know when she began what her results would be? She said she would “collect” lesbians. Lesbian Love Story is part archival history –                                        her                                       story – of lesbians throughout the ages, primarily in the US, and part personal experiences by Amelia. She often blends the two within chapters, interjecting her memories, feelings about her research, and much more.                                      This book consists of seven chapters ranging from Sappho in 595 BC to the 1980s. Possanza opens with a writer, Ruth Fuller Field, who used the pseudonym Mary Casal, Mary lived in the late 19th-early 20th Century. We learn about her relationship with a younger woman named Juno. We learn that “romantic friendships” were common and not necessarily frowned upon, as these were perhaps considered “practice” for “real” marriage. The state of women living together was known as a Boston marriage.                                      In several chapters, the author has chosen examples of women who lived lesbian lifestyles, i.e., apparently intimate relationships with at least one woman, who were married, or had been married to a man. Not all these women were monogamous in their lesbian relationships either, even if they declared themselves to be married to one another. She introduces interesting women from different decades. Mabel Hampton and Lillian Foster were Black women who moved from the South to New York when they were young. They were together for 40 years. Theirs was one example given of a “butch femme” relationship. Amelia learned much about the pair from interviews that Mable recorded. They called each other Big Bear and Little Bear, and Lillian was considered the “wifey.” Babe Didrikson, the famous multi-sport athlete/pro-golfer was another featured “butch” lesbian. Although Lillian “Babe” was married to pro wrestler-promoter George Zaharias, it was a well-known “secret” that Babe was “that way.” She claimed that she’d been taught how to be a lady, but she was still rough around the edges. However, she took Betty Dodd under her wing to make a lady of her, and the two were mostly inseparable. When Babe was dying of cancer in her early 40s, it was Betty who was at her side.                                      Perhaps there was no one more butch than Rusty Brown. Rusty made a living wearing pants to get a man’s job during WWII, and after the war worked as a male impersonator (as did Mabel). There are numerous mentions of drag queens in the book. There’s a hilarious story of the time Rusty and her drag queen partner switched roles one night. Rusty was uncharacteristically in dress and heels. She got arrested for impersonating a woman!                                      No herstory would be complete without Sappho, the Greek poet. She lived on the island of Lesbos – hence, the word lesbian. Because there was no record of her life, little is known about her personal story. Some of her lyric poetry remains; much of it is love poetry, written to be performed to music. She was thought to have killed herself by drowning after throwing herself off a cliff for love of a man named Phaon. However, much of her poetry referred to female beauty, and she got a bad reputation for her “impure friendships” with her female friends. Suffice it to say that Sappho is considered by some to be the “Tenth Muse” because of her lyric poetry and is practically a patron saint to many lesbians. I found parts of this chapter rather confusing, perhaps because of the fuzzy history.                                      Moving on to modern times, the author writes about two Chicana lesbians, Gloria Anzaldúa and Cherríe Moraga in a chapter that focuses on diversity, politics, and community. She describes the women’s pasts, and sadly, Cherríe Moraga is one of the only women I could find who is still alive. There was no women’s study program at the time, so, in order to write her thesis on feminist writings, she designed her own program with the help of her advisor, Sally Miller Gearhart, the first out lesbian to hold a tenure-track position. Gearhart sounded familiar to me. Sure enough – she was one of the women in a 1977 documentary film featuring interviews with 26 gay men and women called Word Is Out: Stories of Some of Our Lives. For her thesis at SF State University, Cherrie wrote, This Bridge Called My Back with Gloria. The seventies also saw the beginning of Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival, the formation of Olivia Records, and lesbian collectives.                                      The final chapter discusses friendship between lesbians and gay men, spotlighting a relationship between a man, Michael, who was dying of AIDS, and the woman, Amy, who nursed and cared for him throughout his illness. The author points out how the broader lesbian community supported their brothers in that same way in the 80s, and how women became more outspoken about healthcare equality, AIDS prevention, and treatment for all.                                      Throughout the book, Amelia inserts her own comments and memories. I think swimming is her first love. At times, it is distracting. Mostly, however, I found it endearing. It is, after all, her journey. In seeking a history, a herstory, to share with others, she discovers her own story and creates one as well. She has some valuable insights to share about gender and gender roles. She is often self-deprecating about her femininity, to which I can somehow relate; by the end, she seems to have come to terms with all her many selves. I could say much more. But please, read it for yourself, even if you’re not lesbian.                                      I received an ARC copy of                                       Lesbian Love Story                                      in exchange for my honest review.

Each chapter explores a different love story from the archival research that Possanza has done, focusing mostly on one of the two people and exploring their life and how their actions and experiences fit into a broad definition of lesbianism.                                      What I didn't realise from the blurb is that out of the seven, all except Sappho spent time in New York (to connect with the author and the memoir element), and there's generally a real focus on twentieth century America. Obviously, you can write a book with a focus, but probably the blurb needs to make this clearer, highlighting the New York connection or something.. The ordering of the chapters is chronological apart from Sappho who is chapter 4, and I wasn't really sure why this was—it was a bit confusing to suddenly have Sappho discussed here and not at the start (or even at the end).                                      The chapters tend to explore broader issues affecting the main ""protagonists"", plus weaving in memoir elements from the author, so there's a lot to move between, and on top of that there's a lot of direct quotes from the individuals from the archives mixed in as well using italics. It is an interesting way to approach delving into archive history and trying to bring people to life, but at times I found it too easy to get lost. The chapter about Gloria Anzaldúa and Cherríe Moraga was most interesting for me, as it explored some of the histories of lesbian communities in the 1970s and 80s particularly and some of the arguments around lesbian separatism (and does mention how this has evolved into modern discourse, but only briefly). The chapter about queer friendship and AIDS very notably lacked any mention of trans women and the impact of AIDS upon them, and in general it is surprising in a book that argues for seeing the variation in lesbian experience and identity to not cover a trans lesbian in one of the chapters.                                      I liked that the ending called for radical change and using these historical figures from the archives as part of this work, as it gave a sense of purpose beyond uncovering histories, to look to the past but also the future. The acceptance that lesbians can have very diverse experiences was also a good note to end on, and in general the ending shows how queer history is important in allowing us to be united rather than divided.                                      Overall, the book wasn't always for me, as sometimes the threads it wove together didn't always work, and I wish it had maybe explored more the New York connection if that was the reason for having those figures chosen to cover. However, there's a lot of engaging content and I did learn about people I'd never heard of before.","288 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","For readers of Saidiya Hartman and Jeanette Winterson,                                 Lesbian Love Story                                is an intimate journey into the archives—uncovering the romances and role models written out of history and what their stories can teach us all about how to love                              When Amelia Possanza moved to Brooklyn to build a life of her own, she found herself surrounded by queer stories: she read them on landmark placards, overheard them on the pool deck when she joined the world’s largest LGBTQ swim team, and even watched them on TV in her cockroach-infested apartment.

The experience of reading this was informed by two previous reads: A Life of One's Own and Lesbian Death - the first being a similar format but not executed with the same amount of insight, or the same balance of personal and historical, and the second challenging the viability of (and in parts lamenting the loss of) the term lesbian from both a political and social context, but Possanza's book was unapologetically lesbian, without being exclusionary. And where in A Life a One's Own the author's story was sometimes a jarring departure from the literary criticism/author biography that dominated the narrative, Possanza's own story, all tied together thematically with swimming, worked perfectly within the other stories she was shedding light on, and never seemed an interruption from the ""true"" story being told.

It's not quite a reimagining of the breadth of relationships, but a reevaluating and revaluing of what lesbian love and community can look like outside the straightjacket of the heteronormativity that was such a commonly used word at the college we both went to. It's definitely an extra win to recognize specific anecdotes through shared history, and feels like the type of book that's a joy to write (partly as I too love the investigative process of archives and the meditative process of swimming), and one my friends are already asking to borrow and read.","288 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","For readers of Saidiya Hartman and Jeanette Winterson,                                 Lesbian Love Story                                is an intimate journey into the archives—uncovering the romances and role models written out of history and what their stories can teach us all about how to love                              When Amelia Possanza moved to Brooklyn to build a life of her own, she found herself surrounded by queer stories: she read them on landmark placards, overheard them on the pool deck when she joined the world’s largest LGBTQ swim team, and even watched them on TV in her cockroach-infested apartment.

That makes it incredibly challenging for history-interested lesbians like Amelia Possanza to find representation and role models. In these essays, Possanza brilliantly weaves together found history of lesbian lovers with her own personal stories about looking for love and building queer community. From better known figures like Sappho and Gloria Anzaldúa to less recognized but fascinating characters, Possanza brings queer history to life and imaginatively fills in some of the gaps in their stories.

It's a beautiful search for ancestors and role models hidden in dusty old archives.                                      Now, all of these women were ones I'd never heard of, with one notable exception - Sappho.                                      And that's the odd thing about this book. Sappho... doesn't really fit in here. Sappho is, in all regards, the odd one out, standing out like a sore thumb.                                      See, there is a very distinct format to this book. Each story is told chronologically, starting with Mary Casal in the late 19th century and ending with Amy Hoffman in the 80s and 90s.                                      Except for Sappho.                                      Every woman has a connection to New York, and a lot of their lives weave together and connect in some way to the life of the author.                                      Except for Sappho.                                      Sappho's chapter is oddly placed in the middle of the book, breaking the chronological order for no clear reason, and there's not even the flimsiest of attempts to tie her to New York. She doesn't really match the archival nature of the other stories either.                                      Did the author just feel obliged to include Sappho because she is the ur-lesbian, the woman who gave us both the words ""sapphic"" and ""lesbian"", the one everyone knows about and expect from a story about lesbian history?                                      Because I don't think that's a very good reason to just cram her in there.                                      Why not put her chapter first? Or maybe tell her story briefly in the prologue? Even ending with her story and tying it all together with a kind of origin story would have made more sense and been more effective.                                      Now, did this in any way affect my experience with this book? Dampen my enjoyment?                                      No, not really.                                      But I do think it's an odd choice, and I do think it weakens the structure of the book.                                      All that said, some odd choices like that aside, this is well-crafted and often beautifully written.                                      My main prolem with the book actually had nothing to do with Sappho and everything to do with the increasing blending of the stories.                                      With each new chapter, the women from previous chapters keep being referenced, presumably to tie all of the stories together, but I felt like it often muddled the narrative, and I kept getting confused about who was who. A few days after having finished this, the stories are already mixed up in my head, and none of them really stand out much in my memory.                                      I think this wasn't necessarily helped by the fact that a lot of the narratives felt a bit samey. Most of the women were more masc leaning people who struggled with traditional femininity, something that seemed to reflect the author's own insecurities around her perceived failure to perform femininity.                                      Not a bad thing in itself, but I think it would have been more interesting to read stories with a wider breadth of experiences, especially since all of them (once again, except for Sappho) where already so close in terms of time period and geographical location.","288 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","For readers of Saidiya Hartman and Jeanette Winterson,                                 Lesbian Love Story                                is an intimate journey into the archives—uncovering the romances and role models written out of history and what their stories can teach us all about how to love                              When Amelia Possanza moved to Brooklyn to build a life of her own, she found herself surrounded by queer stories: she read them on landmark placards, overheard them on the pool deck when she joined the world’s largest LGBTQ swim team, and even watched them on TV in her cockroach-infested apartment.

Drawing on extensive research, personal reimaginings, and various parallels, the author presents a fairly compelling quilt of a narrative.                                      My main draw here was the historical aspect since I do not like and try to actively stay away from memoirs. Especially memoirs written by people who haven’t even hit middle age. Now only do I not care to read them, I also don’t like reviewing them, because it inevitably feels like I’m reviewing the person themselves. But how does one not do that? Seriously, how does one avoid forming judgements when reading heavily confessional accounts seasoned with equally heavy confessional details?                                      Like how do I not think…well, this person is still single because she refers to her partners as lovers like some cheesy SNL sketch? Or question how someone who has relationships with men calls themselves a lesbian?                                      See, what I mean? Profoundly personal business but one certainly opens themselves up to such inquiries when writing a memoir, no? Why even memoir at all? Is it a reflection on out modern culture of oversharing?                                      Why not stick to the historical facts? Those were genuinely interesting. Maybe the author’s story might be too, sometime in the future. But biographical accounts present complete lives, different times and mentalities, different journeys in a much more interesting way. Often not needing interjections of what the author and her lover did or the author’s musings on her unshaven legs.                                      At any rate, whatever you get out of this book, it’s worth a read. It is an objectively clever use of historical research to shed light on past more fascinating and storied than is seen at a brief glance. Because love is love, it has always been there and will always be there, regardless of social mores and conventions.

And it's such a delight! I appreciated the lesbian history, grouped by time period but also thematically and the relatively light sprinkling of memoir woven through. I think a lot about queer history during Pride Month, how far we have come and how far we still need to go. This was such a lovely look at the highs and lows of lesbian history through the years. I appreciated the connections to women's history and how lesbians have negotiated the transgressive nature of resisting (with varying levels of success) a society that saw (still sees?) women as property. I also appreciated that the author wanted to write this book, which is so well done, but also clearly a labor of love. The world needs this book (and others like it), but likely wasn't sitting around waiting for it. Kudos to Possanza and her publisher for bringing it to life.                                      Not a lesbian and wondering whether you'd like this book? I wondered, too. But I just started reading the new biography of Dr. King, and I'm not a Black minister from the mid-century South. We read a lot of books about topics unrelated to our identities because it's important to understand the contours and complexities of the world we live in. This is an excellent, compelling book on a slice of queer history and an enlightening perspective into the impact of both crushing and casual homophobia. And the real lives that emerge in spite of it all.","288 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","For readers of Saidiya Hartman and Jeanette Winterson,                                 Lesbian Love Story                                is an intimate journey into the archives—uncovering the romances and role models written out of history and what their stories can teach us all about how to love                              When Amelia Possanza moved to Brooklyn to build a life of her own, she found herself surrounded by queer stories: she read them on landmark placards, overheard them on the pool deck when she joined the world’s largest LGBTQ swim team, and even watched them on TV in her cockroach-infested apartment.

It had the authors’ personal experiences woven throughout, as well.                                      As a lesbian, it felt very validating, and I enjoyed learning about our history. I also liked that it didn’t ignore trans women. However, I would have liked a little more focus on them, maybe a chapter devoted to a trans woman. I did like that the author noted some of these masc lesbians may have been trans men, which is something I wonder myself.                                      I recommend it a lot! The only thing making this a four star instead of a five is that, for whatever reason, it was a struggle to get through and took me a while to read.

Along the way, she discovers her own love—for swimming, for community, for New York City—and adds her own record to the archive.                              At the heart of this riveting, inventive history, Possanza asks: How could lesbian love help us reimagine care and community? What would our world look like if we replaced its foundation of misogyny with something new, with something distinctly lesbian?"

Since none of the girls spoken about in this are able to tell their own story you rely on Leach's research through speaking with family and friends (the boarding school that they all went to has also since shut down so you don't get much insight on the facility beyond hindsight observations). All the information collected is presented in that friend-telling-you-a-story-about-someone-they-know type of way which makes it really easy to get sucked into but I found myself noticing that the observations were quite surface level and there were frequent points where the book would suddenly throw itself into talking about massively general topics out of nowhere. I'm assuming it was to bridge the gap considering the author wasn't close with any of the girls during the time that she documented in the book but that's why it felt even weirder to me that the author's own reflections on how different her life was from her childhood friend were a lot more sparse than i thought they would be. I think I was just expecting either more detail on the girls' story or the author's to act as support for the lack of first hand perspective from the elissas but it kind of felt like you got a glass half full look on both ends.,"256 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Three suburban girls meet at a boarding school for troubled teens.

Overall, I was expecting the story to be a little more about the 3 girls time at Ponca Pines Academy. I didn't realize until I dove in, that the author, Samantha Leach, childhood best friends of Elissa, didn't actually go to Ponca Pines Academy - only her childhood best friend Elissa, who then went on to meet Alyssa, and Alissa there. Therefore, MOST of this book was early memories - middle school, their time prior to Elissa leaving. I thought this would be more focused on what went on at this Academy (that is now shut down). It was a lot of retellings of all 3 girls being ""troubled teens"" and how they got sent away; not as much as to what happened WHILE they were away. (It was also marketed as ""true crime"" but I don't feel as though that genre's fitting).

Growing up in the wealthy suburbs of Rhode Island, they wanted for nothing. With wealthy parents and access to a fancy life, the girls fell into rebellious socialite behavior. With stars like party girls Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie, whose drunken escapades, rehab stints, and romantic trysts taught a whole generation of younger rich girls what was cool and “hot”—these behaviors were fairly normal, right or wrong. Remember what it was like being a younger teen and wanting to be cool? Samantha was always more reserved than Elissa and when Elissa gets sent away to a different school, they girls lose their close connection. Elissa continues to spiral and eventually gets sent away to be “reformed” by the Trouble Teen industry. There, she meets Alyssa and Alissa. “The Elissas” form a close bond and none of them would wind up living past the age of 26.                                      If you are around my age you will have a special appreciation for some of the things mentioned by Samantha Leach. I related to the thoughts, references and even the suburban sex urban legends! Hell, I even related to a lot of the troubles. But unlike Elissa, I fortunately did not find myself in the Trouble Teen industry. I was fascinated by the stories of these three girls and feel very fortunate that I was able to pull myself out of my own darkness. It was honestly very sad; these three beautiful lives that ended early. Samantha did a lot of research, as well as interviewed people who knew the girls in order to tell their stories. I feel like this book is a mix of memoir, social commentary and maybe even some self-healing on Samantha’s part. I enjoyed reading this book and I think it was brave of Samantha to dive into this when it clearly still causes her so much pain. I hope she feels proud of getting their stories out there. There were a few articles and such mentioned I definitely want to go read in full now.

One by one they left those programs. And one by one they died.                                       For as long as I knew Elissa, her life was defined by her desire to burn the brightest. A hunger to experience it all, despite the consequences, that made her destined to burn fast, and then burn out.                                      (loc. 2150*)                                      In                                       The Elissas                                      , Leach traces what happened to her childhood best friend—Elissa—and then, too, what happened to Alyssa and Alissa. And what's there is disturbing: all the messiness of the troubled teen industry, which seems largely designed to empty wealthy parents' bank accounts and keep teens under as strict a control as possible, with little regard for the consequences.                                      I've read a lot of troubled teen industry books—a number have come out recently, including Paris Hilton's                                       memoir                                      (that one I have not read, and Leach does not reference it, but she does talk about the recent documentary about Paris Hilton, which to my understanding covers some of the same material). What this reminds me of most, though, is                                       The Forgotten Girls                                      , which is similarly by a woman who ""got out"" and is tracing the life of one who didn't. Where                                       The Forgotten Girls                                      is about small-town poverty, though,                                       The Elissas                                      is set against a backdrop of wealth and privilege—the kind that keeps girls in boarding schools rather than jail cells, but not a kind that can save them from addiction and trauma.                                      Leach was not immune to the things that pulled Elissa under, but while Elissa sunk deeper and deeper, Leach managed to tread water. She doesn't ask as many of the hard questions as Potts does, and the more memoir (vs. researched) sections about her own life don't draw as sharp a contrast or make so strong a point, but it's clear that this book was a labor of love—something to memorialize three girls who would otherwise by forgotten by history.

That quote from this memoir sums up what I feel about the book. The author in some ways perpetuated that cycle of fetishization with this memoir, picking over the lives of three young women, only one of whom she actually knew, and even then, for a relatively limited time and in relatively limited ways. While I was in some ways educated about the ""troubled teen industry"" the book didn't sit well because it felt like a taking of other people's tragedies and trying to own them, because they were 'romantic' and evocative of the stories that she found compelling when she was younger. It almost felt at times like she envied these young women the drama of their lives, particularly when she luxuriated in the details of their descent from ""nice, white middle-class girls"" to addicts, spiraling toward destruction, occasionally succumbing to the trap of centering her own emotional reaction to the tragedy rather than the tragedies themselves.                                      The Elissas, despite her best efforts (and I do believe she tried) are not so much humanized as made object lessons. But of what? The fate of affluent white ""troubled teens"" as different but no less tragic than their Black and brown, not-so-affluent counterparts (racial disparities are mentioned several times and well-cited)? Of the failure of the addiction industry? Illustrations of the need for regulations of unlicensed 'treatment' facilities? Or just another sad story, made sadder because these are not the kinds of girls this was supposed to happen to?                                      Since the author was not present for almost any of what happened to these young women, there was very little dialogue and what little there was, appeared at the most insignificant moments. A boyfriend who wants to leave to go hang out and use instead of spending time with his also addicted girlfriend says,                                       ""All right. I'm gonna head out.""                                      She says                                       ""What the fuck? Where are you going?""                                      He says                                       ""Just meeting up with some people.""                                      She says,                                       ""Are you serious right now?""                                      He says,                                       ""...Yes?""                                      She says,                                       ""Fuck you.""                                      He says,                                       ""Fuck me?""                                      She says,                                       ""Yes.""                                      He says,                                       ""Wow. Fuck this. I'm out of here.""                                      That kind of exchange was typical of the dialogue—inane exchanges that offer little insight about the interiors of the young women, but sound like something in a movie like, 'Less Than Zero', or 'Candy' (a Heath Ledger movie she cites, as an example of how popular culture romanticizes love intertwined with addiction).                                      Though some of the writing was insightful and incisive, and there were copious citations to support most of her assertions, I never could get a handle on what this book was trying to accomplish. The one Elissa the author actually knew, she successfully disentangled herself from long before the most acute phases of her addiction began, but upon Elissa's death, the author's preoccupation resumes and expands, now encompassing two other young women she didn't even know, and finally manifesting itself in this book, which at times seems less an examination of their unique but similar tragedies than an expression of the author's own continuing desire to consume other people's pain and repurpose it for herself.                                      In the Afterword, the author mentions that a friend suggested that she check out Al-Anon and my first thought was,                                       ""Oh, thank God""                                      . And I felt similarly when she acknowledges that she's                                       ""always felt more comfortable in the chaos of others' lives than the monotony of [her] own.""                                      After reading this book, part of me was like, ""ya                                       think                                         ?""","256 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Three suburban girls meet at a boarding school for troubled teens.

The synopsis is a little misleading, it wants you to think the three girls deaths are all connected, ( and they are, only by them being friends). So I thought I was getting a boarding school, reveal all, type book that investigates shady circumstances behind their deaths. This is not at all what the book is about. It’s about the girls battle with addiction, and how society shut them out.                                      I’m so glad I continued to read it, even after I figured out it wasn’t what I expected.                                      The Elissas is Samantha Leach’s way of coming to terms with her friends death. What starts off as a trip down memory lane, becomes a deep dive into the Troubled Teen Industry. It’s eye opening and heartbreaking. Most of these “troubled teens” that get sent off to the correction camps or boarding schools, are just teens figuring out who they are. What they needed was therapy. Girls that are dealing with eating disorders and the beginnings of addictions, are sent away and punished. Most of the time the punishments are cruel, and result in more acting up. It is really all pointless and harmful. So damn sad.                                      Women have been tortured and sent away for centuries, for misbehaving. Because they don’t fit into society the right way, there must be something wrong with them. It has always bothered me that asylums once held women, giving them shock treatment, just for inappropriate thoughts. Now, those girls are sent away even younger, with the hopes of correcting them earlier. They are sent to pricey boarding schools that, may not use shock therapy anymore, but definitely emotionally torture them.                                      Can you tell this book got me all jazzed up? Lol I could dissect this topic for hours, but Samantha Leach does it very well in this book. She did the research, talked to the right people, and included personal experiences in this powerful book.","256 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Three suburban girls meet at a boarding school for troubled teens.

Bustle editor Samantha Leach's exposé of the Troubled Teen Industry reads as both a warning and a regretful love letter to her lost friends. Prior to Paris Hilton recently opening up about her times at such institutions I had never given them much thought, let alone considered all the moving parts that created the industry, despite an estimated 50,000 teens being sent to troubled teen programs each year, with many coming from the suburbs.                                      🚩HOW THE INDUSTRY WORKS🚩                                      Parents concerned about their teenagers ""acting out"" tend to head to their computers in search of answers, where they often make a connection to a college counselor-type consultant, unaware that these consultants ""are often receiving financial kickbacks from these programs, earning a fee each time they place someone in their care."" These desperate parents often agree to a short-term wilderness program for their teen. Next, it is usually suggested to parents that they have their teen stay on for another few weeks, months, etc., and then recommended that they transition to a therapeutic boarding school (a recommendation that persuades 40 to 45 percent of parents) like Ponca Pines (located in Nebraska, where teens are considered minors until the age of nineteen.) The initial short-term wilderness programs are essentially ""preparation for later selling [parents] on a long-term stay at a boarding school. All of which contributes to the $1.2 billion profit the industry turns annually.""                                      I was outraged to learn the intricacies of this system that inflicts more damage on teens while preying on wealthy parents looking to get their rebellious teenagers in line. Hopefully, books such as this, outspoken advocates, and work done by the nonprofit Breaking Code Silence will not only expose the horrors of this unregulated industry but lead to a full reformation or dismantling.

The author, Samantha Leach, grew up in the suburbs with Elissa - they attended the same schools, had crushes on similar boys, and broke a lot of the same rules. Leach made it through their early teen rebellion pretty much unscathed, but Elissa was sent away to become a cog in the Troubled Teen Industry and died when she was only eighteen. To cope with her feelings, Leach spends years investigating what exactly happened to Elissa and learns more about her bond with Alyssa and Alissa and the factors that lead to their tragic deaths.

The author wasn’t with the three girls when they were in the school and wasn’t close friends with Elissa once she started getting into serious trouble, so the book is mainly anecdotal and felt like the author was stretching to insert herself into someone else’s tragedy.                                                * thanks to Grand Central Publishing for the NetGalley review copy.

Samantha Leach shares the stories of three teenagers who all met while at a Troubled Teen Industry school in Nebraska and introduces you to additional individuals who knew them at different points in their lives. Elissa, Alyssa, and Alissa were bonded during their time together, with similar partying habits and lifestyles. Within 8 years of leaving Ponca Pines, all three would be dead. Leach grew up with Elissa and felt haunted by her passing. Their lives and deaths left a lasting impact on Leach, which she explores in The Elissas.                                        I highlighted many excerpts from The Elissas, beginning with chapter 1. Leach writes, ""Beauty as far as I could tell, didn't exempt you from any of life's hardships. But in Elissa's mind, beauty equaled absolution. That's what society had instructed her, anyway...Like many young women who grew up ingesting the detritus of our culture's obsession with attractive women, Elissa bought into the false promise that good looks would grant her immunity from her inner, unspoken pain."" This criticism of pop culture's beauty standards and fixation stood out to me, as this had a negative impact on Elissa's life.                                            Leach pairs stories about Elissa, Alyssa, and Alissa with research and statistics to show readers how their stories connect to others across the US. I recommend this book to anyone interested in a deeper dive about the Troubled Teen Industry and how these environments affect individuals' paths differently.

The cons: Major issues include the author’s use of inherently judgmental terms (“drugging,” “addict,” “junkie”; if she was modeling her language after the words used by the Elissas when they were alive, that could have used a disclaimer), and more importantly the way the author divorces her story from Elissa’s not in a “that could’ve been me” way but a “that wasn’t me because I’m different.”                                      The pros: Having grown up in a town adjacent to Alissa N (not sure which spelling she used because I listened to the audiobook), this book brought back for me the remembering of girls I went to school with being fed into the troubled teen industry. Further, I appreciated the context of coming of age in the late 2000s/early 2010s; I found the description of the societal norms being impressed on the Elissas to be accurate and relevant.","256 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Three suburban girls meet at a boarding school for troubled teens.

While the series takes a top-down down approach at the origins of the institutions themselves, this account follows the lives of three girls, Elissa, Alyssa, and Alissa, who went through it. It’s a really difficult read, especially with each of the subjects being so close in age to yours truly. The way they talk about the values and value of a teen girl in the context of growing up in the early naughts was rough, especially since it was a time where disordered eating seemed to be encouraged.                                      What this book touches on, I think, is the abhorrent way parents and people in positions of power and instruction treat teen girls as disposable. The way it dovetails into discussion of the overdose epidemic and drug use reiterates that the kids sent to these boarding schools would rather not be treated as humans, but problems to be fixed. There are deep wounds and perceptions of lack that abuse and severe restriction to access to family and familiarity won’t fix and may, in fact, exacerbate. The compassion the text here shows to girls who have a dearth of esteem because the only value they’ve ever been shown to have is superficial is incredible.                                      A difficult read, but highly recommended for lived experiences of teens who went through the troubled teen industry.","256 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Three suburban girls meet at a boarding school for troubled teens.

In South Florida in the 1970’s, there was a controversial program called The Seed where many of my older siblings’ friend were sent. If you got caught smoking weed or drinking, off you went. It seemed like a horrific punishment for normal adolescent behavior, and in fact The Seed’s techniques were modeled after Syananon and were later compared to North Korean brainwashing techniques.⁣                                      ⁣                                      The author was childhood friends with the Elissa of the title, and struggled to make sense of her old friend Elissa’s untimely death as well as of two other women, Alissa and Alyssa. The author and Elissa grew up during the era of Paris Hilton and The Simple Life, but Elissa was the one who engaged in wild partying and questionable sexual behavior. While Ms. Leach went on to graduate high school, Elissa was shipped off to the first of the boarding schools that promised to “reform” her behavior.⁣                                      ⁣                                      Elissa later met and befriended Alissa and Alyssa who were also typically rebellious teenagers.

These horrifying scared straight style programs are having another moment in the spotlight right now thanks to Paris Hilton’s memoir, and it’s never been more apparent just how dangerous and damaging such programs are on teens.                                      The author seems to insinuate that these young women, despite the troubles they had before being enrolled in such programs, might be alive today had they not been subject to them. I’m inclined to agree with her, and there’s a lot of hard data to support that viewpoint.                                      I wasn’t a huge fan of the author herself or her role in this.

Still, I think she has the right of the real issue, which is that predatory programs like this not only                                      don’t “fix” teens the way that they claim to.

It's more a narrative about these girls who happened to experience the industry for a few years maybe, but there's not much substance from their stays other than that they were generally bad and possibly abusive. Also, while I'm not supporting these programs at all, it's important to note that these girls weren't sent for no reason. They were self-destructive and even committing crimes like theft for fun. And this is important bc the author seems to link these programs to their deaths, but it seems clear to me that regardless of their stays at various boarding programs, they could have still died in those exact same ways. It seems even more likely actually bc they would have continued in their self-destructive behaviors and various drugs without anyone keeping them in check and with all the privilege that came with being wealthy young white women.                                      **Received a free copy from Netgalley                                      My main takeaway from this is less about the troubled teen industry, and more about her obsession with her childhood friend. She says this story is about three girls, but she only knew one of them up to maybe 12-13 years old. And she talks about herself about as much as she talks about them, which leads me to believe this is just as much about her and how she was ""just as bad."" Which felt weird. I think this is good look into the privileged lives of rich white girls, and nothing more.","256 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Three suburban girls meet at a boarding school for troubled teens.

This is a testament to how well Leach distilled her research and interview transcripts into an actual story. As someone who was 13 in 2003 in small-town Ohio, this story was resonant and incredibly familiar.                                      I, too, have been the ""Sami"" to an ""Elissa."" I understand how charismatic and charming an Elissa can be, especially when trying to set your worries at ease. Leach also sets their behavior within the broader social climate of the time: The Simple Life and all things Paris Hilton, a time of velour tracksuits and thong underwear from Wet Seal, flirting late at night on AIM. Nostalgic details, perhaps, but they exist in lockstep with the mainstream discourse that praised airheaded-ness and Britney Spears's abs (1000 crunches a day). Gonzo porn had never been more accessible for young viewers and, thanks to a ""return to purity"" that emphasized abstinence, it served as sex ed for a generation.                                      Essentially, Elissa and the countless women like her did not emerge out of nowhere, like Venus on a beach. So what to do with ""bad girls"" like her? Well, as Leach describes, if you grew up in poverty, you can count on incarceration. But if you're affluent, like Elissa's family, the Troubled Teen industry is there to prey on parents' concerns.                                      One weakness, which is no fault of Leach's, is that because the horrors of Troubled Teen programs have only recently been exposed, there has not yet been a chance for enough peer-reviewed research or long-term studies to examine the full negative impact on survivors' lives. So she relies on first-person accounts to shed light on the abusive conditions teens were exposed to. These conditions leave even ""successful graduates"" ill-equipped to be actual adults, forever bouncing around in the ""perfect and compliant"" vs ""bad kid"" dichotomy.                                      This dichotomy certainly trapped Elissa, and it seems to have contributed to the deaths of Alyssa and Alissa, too, who were her best friends at Ponca Pines. Considering that the author never met Alyssa or Alissa, they did emerge as fully drawn characters with their own individual struggles.                                      The reason why this wasn't a 5-star read for me was because I felt the ending was pretty rushed. For a book containing a lot of analysis, I was surprised that there wasn't more to really bring the book together in the end. We also get breadcrumbs throughout that the author began going to Al-Anon--and this thread seems to be incredibly important but given very little space in the book.                                      I can't help but think there's more to that story than her link to Elissa, so it felt like the author was withholding*. I suppose what I'm asking for more is more of a connection to be made between the social forces that yes, created the Elissas, but just as significantly, also created their best friends, who perhaps lived in their shadows, but survived.                                      *I don't believe an author owes readers every detail of their life, and she might have felt like some details were too personal or unrelated to the story of the Elissas, but honestly it really did just come across like there are missing, important pieces, and I wouldn't have minded if the author was inserted more into the book.","256 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Three suburban girls meet at a boarding school for troubled teens.

The other catch: the author, Samantha Leach, an editor and writer, was childhood best friends with one of the Elissas. Haunted by her friend's death at 18, and the survivor's guilt that came with it, Leach sets out to explore the interplay of things that led to these tragic deaths. She traces the trajectory of each girl's life, interviewing friends and family to take us closer into their worlds and into their last days, giving the book an intimate feel. What separates these three girls from the legions of other girls who have similar issues--depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and a preoccupation with pop culture and beauty? She lays quite a lot of weight on the therapeutic boarding school industry, where kids are often shamed into compliance and into molding themselves into a cisgender white cultural norm, since most of these kids come from affluent suburban families. After all, who else can afford the high cost of these programs? She also touches on the effect of the culture of the early 2000s, when Paris Hilton, Nicole Ritchie, Lindsay Lohan, the Kardashians and other beautiful young adults ran wild and fast, often flaunting their out-of-control partying and other risky behaviors. The book is most interesting as a story of three girls' lives. Sometimes the editorializing can feel like armchair psychology, mostly because there are so many complex factors at play here (addiction, eating disorders, sex addiction, mental illness, cultural studies, divorce, the troubled teen industry). As someone who had a sister and a daughter go through the troubled teen industry, I have complex feelings about all of these issues. This book completely drew me in, though, because in telling the stories of these three girls, it left me with more questions than answers, and a feeling of ""There but for the grace of God go we all.""","256 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Three suburban girls meet at a boarding school for troubled teens.

Very odd to have three Elissas but they all collided in a troubled teen camp.                                      The author would love you to believe that the troubled teen camp that the girls' parents paid for was the basis of their untimely demise.                                      The author provides some facts/studies that demonized the troubled teen camp/schools.                                      Further, she brings up the media sensations of Nicole Ritchie, Paris Hilton, etc.                                      Yet, this is all superficial. She was friends with Elissa, but they parted ways right around the age of 14. When Elissa was kicked out of private school for sex(?)...this wasn't clear. they barely knew each other when Elissa died from encephalitis.                                      The author didn't know the other two girls, Alissa and Alyssa. They were friends of Elissa NOT the author. so the author stalked Elissa's facebook page to gather information.                                      The story, while entertaining, was jarring at how the author would insert herself into the story, for instance the while Elissa was experimenting with Oxy, I started Lorazepam. It was almost like the author needed to validate her own self because Elissa was doing heavier drugs.                                      I kept wondering who was this book for? This is not a true crime book. This is not an expose of suburbia, there was no deep dive into that. This was not a condemnation of what makes a celebrity.                                      It felt like this was an apology letter to Elyssa for not being a good friend.                                      Who would read this?

The Elissas is a narrative nonfiction book that follows three ""troubled"" teens throughout their lives in and out of the Troubled Teen Industry. The three girls are all uncannily named Elissa, Alyssa, and Alissa, and all meet at Ponca Pines, a therapeutic boarding school that touts a reputation for ""reforming"" troubled teens. The Elissas explores the dark side of the Troubled Teen Industry that preys on wealthy white families and their drug- and alcohol- abusing teens. Leach knew Elissa, and spins a tale of Elissa's troubles and time in different therapeutic boarding schools. She also tells the similar stories of Alyssa and Alissa in tandem with Elissa's. The result is an eye-opening narrative about the dark side of this predatory industry.                                      I did NOT know very much about the Troubled Teen Industry or about how dark and predatory it can be. This was a very eye-opening read and I loved that it was told in narrative format even if it is all completely based on true stories. That's a testament to Leach's writing - it was sometimes difficult to remember that I was reading a nonfiction book. It led me to want to learn more about this industry... and I actually did some googling and found out there are two of these therapeutic boarding schools very close to where I live. This was definitely outside my comfort zone but I'm so glad that I read it!","256 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Three suburban girls meet at a boarding school for troubled teens.

Although I know of the troubled teen industry, I hadn’t necessarily done any reading on it. This book is about three girls entwined by said industry and is an interesting glimpse into a world widely hidden until recently.                                      By the end of the book, I felt as if all three ‘Elissas’ collectively became one through the story telling. Although each of the Elissas stories are unique, we know from the beginning that they unfortunately are left to the same fate. Through the intertwining of their stories, a collective ‘Elissa’ appeared rather than three separate girls, and left me with a solid takeaway of three tragedies that intersected in one place: The Troubled Teen Industry.                                      I liked learning of the statistics behind addiction, the troubled teen industry and its’ long-term effects throughout the book thanks to the author’s thorough research- it could serve as a wake-up call to those unaware that we could easily be the author, and that any of these three young women could have been a close friend. I will be recommending this to friends and followers that are interested in learning more about this industry and it’s’ many inherent flaws.

I wasn't aware of this phenomenon, so I appreciated the crash course in this upsetting ""fix-it"" type boarding schools for girls who need course correcting. This idea of reform school seems to be around for a while, but the author Samantha Leach is making a connection now between these girls experiences at the school and their later drug addictions which ultimately all lead to their extremely premature deaths. It reminded me a lot of THREE WOMEN, though it wasn't as much of a success.                                      The author was childhood friends with Elissa, though they drift apart by high school. Elissa meets Alissa and Alyssa at the boarding school. It is a little strange for the author to have a close connection with one of the girls, but never meeting the other two, which I think leads to a bit of a disconnected. The way the book is blurbed, as well, makes it seems much more like there is a true crime mystery at the heart of the book. However, it is instead an indictment on the drug epidemic within suburbia, and particularly white women, which is a tragedy but certainly not a ground-breaking book topic. While I feel the book is important and the story heartbreaking, I'm not sure who or what this is for and what the book wants to accomplish other than honoring these girls.","256 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Three suburban girls meet at a boarding school for troubled teens.

This book follows their short lives, their early years in their wealthy but troubled families, their time within the Troubled Teen Industry and their dependence on drugs and alcohol. This is a well written book and easy to read, but I’m honestly not quite sure why it was written. The author does talk about some of these boarding schools that charge exorbitant rates to rich and desperate parents while being poorly regulated and often abusive but it definitely is not an expose on the subject. It also discusses the rise of the opioid epidemic in suburban enclaves but once again only skims the surface. It is a portrait of three troubled girls, but only one of which she had any sort of relationship with so it felt too voyeuristic to me.

I have read two other books this year linking back specifically to the wilderness treatment programs. When I was approached to read The Elissas, I jumped at the chance. It gives a completely unique perspective of the programs. Samantha Leach's longtime friend Elissa was sent to one of these programs and then to a boarding school. Where she was punished for rebelling and pushing the envelope with drugs and sex. Her parents, trying to find the best option available chose this path. Leading her to meet two other girls, Alyssa, and Alissa. Both having trouble with drugs, sex, eating disorders, and a plethora of other issues that plague young teenage girls. They all ended up at Ponca Pines and each one of their lives were cut extremely short. Is it because of these treatments programs that are astonishingly extreme. Pushing the girls beyond their limits and leaving them grasping for love and the sense of freedom. Or were they doomed from the beginning?                                      This is a hard hitting, extremely well researched book. You can tell that Leach had a close connection to Elissa and genuinely wanted to lay her to rest in the best way possible. It is disturbing when you take a closer look at what some young girls and women are going through. How they are transported, at times kidnapped from their bed, and taken from everyone and everything they know to start to rebuild their lives. I can never understand how anything can succeed, when you begin with a fake kidnapping. The one aspect I did have a challenging time with was the repetitive information. It felt like each topic was repeated in a different way for each of the three girls. I tended to skim through these parts. I feel like all three girls were on the same carousel of doing everything in their power to either shine the brightest or shrink beneath everyone's stare.

On the surface, it's an examination of the troubled teen industry but the book rarely delves into the specifics of the experiences that the young women at the center of the book faced, instead it tries to trace a through line through three of these women and the author herself, and how each were shaped by the pressures and issues of growing up in the early 2000s. There's a lot of references to various other troubled teen novels and articles, but because the author was not present at the ""school"" it comes across as very surface level without a deeper glimpse at what was actually going on. This problem also exists through the two ""Elissas"" that the author did not personally know.

After reading Say Anarcha, I'm almost speechless. Fortunately, author J.C. Hallman found the words because this is an important part of the history of racism, patriarchy, surgery, and women's rights. Thankfully, the afterword is hopeful, or I'd finish this book really depressed.                                      Dr. Sims did experimental surgery for fistula on enslaved women. He didn't make any attempt at anesthesia beyond telling the suffering women that they'd be punished if they cried or screamed. Anarcha had 30 or more experimental operations, with no painkillers. All the operations failed. Never-the-less, Dr. Sims wrote articles and gave speeches claiming success. HIs ultimate goal wasn't curing as much as it was getting wealthy off of rich white women who also needed surgery for fistula. (Fistula is the tearing of the vagina during difficult pregnancies allowing feces and urine to escape through the birth canal.)                                      Anarcha and the other enslaved women learned to assist during the surgeries and proved to be better at providing aftercare than the doctors. What did they get for their heroism and hard work? Nothing but being sent back to plantations to be overworked and unpaid. Plus, Sims pretended he didn't know Anarcha because he didn't want the rich women to know his surgeries on her failed. How's that for gratitude to the woman he experimented on more than 30 times?                                      This book also includes a lot about the history of the times. Included are biographies of the various surgeons. Much of the thoughts and feelings of Anarch are conjecture because her history before and after her surgeries wasn't recorded. Though she was a fine doctor herself to the enslaved on the plantations, and to the white families in the big house, she was never taught to read or write. Anarcha delivered countless babies and had a deep knowledge of medicinal herbs from the forests.                                      As I mentioned, if it wasn't for the optimistic afterword about the care of fistula today, this is an emotionally difficult book to read. There is horrible abuse of the enslaved, very sexist treatment of all women, and the descriptions of experimental and cruel surgeries on women and animals.                                      It's an important story, though. I learned much about the history of slavery, medicine, and attitudes of the past.

Marion Sims was hailed as the “father of modern gynecology.” He founded a hospital in New York City and had a profitable career treating gentry and royalty in Europe, becoming one of the world’s first celebrity surgeons. Statues were built in his honor, but he wasn’t the hero he had made himself appear to be.                              Sims’s greatest medical claim was the result of several years of experimental surgeries―without anesthesia―on a young enslaved woman known as Anarcha; his so-called cure for obstetric fistula forever altered the path of women’s health.                              One medical text after another hailed Anarcha as the embodiment of the pivotal role that Sims played in the history of surgery. Decades later, a groundswell of women objecting to Sims’s legacy celebrated Anarcha as the “mother of gynecology.” Little was known about the woman herself. The written record would have us believe Anarcha disappeared; she did not.                              Through tenacious research, J. C. Hallman has unearthed the first evidence of Anarcha’s life that did not come from Sims’s suspect reports. Hallman reveals that after helping to spark a patient-centered model of care that continues to improve women’s lives today, Anarcha lived on as a midwife, nurse, and “doctor woman.”                              Say Anarcha excavates history, deconstructing the biographical smoke screen of a surgeon who has falsely been enshrined as a medical pioneer and bringing forth a heroic Black woman to her rightful place at the center of the creation story of modern women’s health care."

I am an African American woman. After reading the blurb that revealed this novel would investigate Dr. Sims’s medical experimentation on enslaved women - I knew this would be a difficult but necessary and essential read. I was familiar “enough” with Dr. Sim’s work, after all, he was heralded in the medical field for his gynecological work; but methods and ethics were called into question and criticized to the point that his NYC statue was removed amid the controversial findings. No doubt this book would not be an easy read – I’d have to center my chi, prepare my heart, adjust my mindset, and say a prayer for the ancestors before diving into what would be no doubt some emotionally challenging and horrendous revelations.                                      The author delivers a page-turning narrative that alternates Anarcha’s story with Sims’. Early chapters chronicle his mediocre beginnings and struggles to pursue medicine to prove himself worthy of a love interest, a quest for fame and fortune as a credible practitioner of medicine. Anarcha’s story is largely imagined, but plausible, as the understudy of an enslaved “doctoring woman”/midwife who happened to be an expert herbalist. The experimental techniques and surgical practices were gruesome (honestly, many were nothing short of trial and error – torture resulting in a lifetime of pain, suffering, and humiliation) and far from today’s recommended and proven practices of modern medicine.                                      I admire J.C. Hallman’s dedication to finding Anarcha - his perseverance led to the discovery of her beginnings, her travels, her acquaintances, family, and final resting place. I loved how he balanced her life with that of Sims’ and methodically, logically dispelled Sim’s false claims revealing his duplicitous and deceitful nature.

It was a set of stories about individuals and how they fit into an important time in history. It was a guided path through the painful past of women’s health in the US and beyond. I learned so much about people and events that I didn’t know about. It taught me, while drawing me in with the humanness of the people that were the center of the book. It reminded me over and over about how the world today reflects the events of the past.                                      The stories were three-dimensional and drew me in: I felt like I was present with the people, seeing them and observing their experiences. The life of Anarcha, Ankey, Annacay was revealed plainly, thoroughly and sympathetically. The writing allowed me the opportunity to try to understand her experience in a way that would be difficult to do through a recitation of history. The story of J. Marion Sims was also laid out clearly and fairly, showing motivations and impact, intended and otherwise. There were so many others who wove in and out of their inter-connected story.                                      The author’s care, curiosity and attention to detail were visible throughout. I experienced as I read the book how invested he was in sharing the story and all he has learned on his journey of writing it. Full disclosure that a long-time friend of mine is the author’s sister. Having read his prior books, I know he’s a talented writer, but wow this was another level.

Thank you Goodreads, Henry Holt and Co., and J.C. Hallman.                                      I had to force myself to start reading this. From the description, you know it’s going to be equal turns heart breaking and gut wrenching. I also found it absolutely engrossing.                                      The book does suffer from an expected pitfall I’ve seen from other dual/multiple biographies: it’s often difficult to keep all the different people straight.                                      Other than that, it’s written wonderfully well—it almost reads like fiction. Indeed, in the introduction, the author likens it to “speculative nonfiction”, as so little is known of the actual woman Anarcha, herself.                                      There’s already so much history to unpack here, and yet unexpectedly, the author also includes astronomical history. I wasn’t expecting that, and I still don’t understand the connection, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.                                      In conclusion, what elevated this to a 5 star read for me was the epilogue. Learning about how fistula is being treated in present day Africa really brought everything full circle.

Thank you, Henry Holt & Company and LibraryThing, for this free ARC in exchange for an honest review.                                      Excellent writing on a disturbing part of U. S. history.                                      In the introduction, the author describes this book as speculative nonfiction--meaning there is only so much information about Anarcha, so it's not all absolute certainties. She's not someone like Oscar Wilde, who left plenty of writing, including letters and manuscripts. With that in mind, it makes sense that this is speculative. Some historians might disapprove, but I like how the author imagines what Anarcha was thinking in certain situations.                                      A shower of meteors in 1833, when Anarcha was seven years old, helps set the stage. It was a bizarre occurrence that people didn't understand at the time. The book describes what life was like for slaves in Alabama.                                      We follow the doctor J. Marion Simms through his childhood and youth. As a student, he--like his buddies--was a mediocre white male. He was also small, unremarkable, and an unimpressive student. He wanted to become a doctor... because he wanted to impress the local doctor's daughter and marry her... but his father owed the same (wealthy) doctor money and disapproved.                                      I could write ""WTF"" in the margins on every page. Of course this book is profoundly disturbing.                                      It's one thing to read a brief statement or briefly hear on a podcast that J. Marion Sims, long touted as ""the father of modern gynecology"" tortured Black women slaves by experimenting on them without anesthetic. That's what I had read/heard before reading this book. This of course goes into details. Whether you're reading about everyday slave life or about white male doctors and how they treat female patients, WTF.                                      Anarcha and Sims met while he was treating patients for malaria and she worked as his assistant. They met nine months later, and she was a patient--the overseer raped her and she became pregnant and had fistula. Sims soon examined two more patients, Betsey and Lucy, who also had fistula.                                      Before long, he expanded the Negro Hospital and was using it for his fistula experiments on ten Black women who were slaves. Not long after that, Anarcha learned that Dr. Nathan Harris bought her and the other women with fistula. Most slavers didn't want slaves who had fistula.                                      The book consistently shows Sims wanting to be rich and famous--attempting to cure fistula was less about compassion for women and more about his own ambition. He gives me the impression that he has a Napoleon complex. Originally he wanted to avoid gynecology, but circumstances led him to experimenting on Black slaves who had fistula.                                      Some readers might think the book repetitive at times, but that’s only because it gives multiple perspectives in the same situations.                                      Dr. Nathan Bozeman--in 1878 described as ""the greatest gynecologist in the world""--joined Sims's practice in Alabama and figured out Sims's quirks and flaws... and suspected him of spreading false rumors about his cure for fistula. Bozeman became his partner in 1853 and figured out Sims was deceitful about his alleged cure and also that he didn't give another doctor credit for inventing the sutures he was using.                                      Not long after that falling out and Bozeman moving to Europe, Sims got approval and board members and opened a Women’s Hospital in NYC.                                      I'm glad the Blackwell sisters are mentioned quite a bit. Sims didn't respect them (because... sexist) and didn't let Elizabeth Blackwell have a high position in his Women’s Hospital, because he insisted in having male doctors. The Blackwells ended up starting their own hospital for women--which the ever-entitled Sims resented, accusing them of taking patients away from him.                                      An awful lot of women died after Sims operated on them. He even performed clitoredectomies--surgically removing the clitoris.                                      There's a large cast of characters. I even learned new things about Abraham Lincoln. The journalist Mary Booth is brilliant, and I'd read a biography about her.                                      Sims and his fellow (white male) gynecologists working at the Women’s Hospital in NYC are cringy with disrespect toward women. The patronizing attitude toward the Board of Lady Managers combines with Sims's dodgy approach to medicine--experimenting on women, practicing clitoredectomies, cutting up patirnts too much, and killing off patients with alarming frequency. I realize this book is set in the nineteenth century, but it justifies my belief that cisgender men should not be gynecologists.                                      Dr. Sims was, in short, an ambitious and deceitful white male supremacist--a Confederate, no less--with, as the saying goes, the confidence of a mediocre white male. He was really into controlling women. He owned slaves and operated on slaves without regard for their pain and comfort. Many of his contemporaries disapproved of his methods--for instance, accusing him of cutting up women too much (a valid complaint). Fortunately, people have generally stopped praising him, and the statue of him was torn down.                                      He never even cured Anarcha of fistula, despite his smug claims--including public claims--to the contrary. At least she did escape slavery at the end of the war and found peace... but she walked with a cane and had the horrible symptoms of fistula to the end.                                      Before reading this book, I only knew of fistula as something that happens because of genital mutilation. Prolonged labor can also cause it--and children being married off and impregnated too young certainly doesn't help. The book has an excellent Afterword that covers hopeful fistula treatments--especially in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Uganda--in the 20th and 21st century. It covers the founding of Joy Village, a sanctuary (that I've previously heard of) for women who have been shunned for having fistula.

The effort of Hallman to present an alternative view to the gynecological work done by J. Marion Sims and others is important, just as showing the impact on a specific individual, Anarcha, of repeated, uninformed and ill advised procedures could be. Black slaves were by far the most victimized of a man’s desire for fame and attention, but the book clearly demonstrates the both racist and misogynistic views that many “doctors”, prevalently white men, had during the time the events in this book take place. Slaves suffered the most from the experimentation that took place, but women of all races and backgrounds were experimented on. Readers should be cautioned that descriptions can be very graphic for those that do not have a medical background, and those that do have a medical background will also likely be horrified by the nature in which these women were treated. The book sends important messages about the history of healthcare and the real people that suffered as a result, many times unnecessarily. These are problems addressed by the book. The book itself also has problematic issues that have nothing to do with its primary focus. Hallman at times has a difficult time staying on task, creating an unnecessarily long book with a narrative that goes off topic and can sometimes go back and forth in time depending on who and what the current focus is. There is way too much attention given to astronomical events, to the Maury family, to events of the Civil War and almost the last tenth of book is dedicated to an afterward about fistula in more modern day Africa. None of these are bad, and some would be interesting as separate studies, but it is too much unnecessary content on top of the intertwined lives of Anarcha and Sims. Hallman states at the beginning that the book is speculative nonfiction, which means that the reader needs to keep this in mind every time emotions and motives are presumed. And while he states that the sources are so extensive that the reader should go out to a website to see them, trimming back unrelated content and providing at least a select biography of more major sources (with a direction to the complete list) would have been nice as a reader. A complimentary copy of this book was provided by the publisher.

Marion Sims and his contributions to modern gynecology. J.C. Hallman delves into the lives of three slaves—Anarcha, Ankey, and Annacay—and their harrowing experiences as subjects of Sims' experiments in the name of medical advancement. Through this book, readers gain valuable historical insights into the lives of these three women, shedding light on their stories that were tragically overlooked due to the prevailing devaluation of slaves and their narratives.                                      One of the notable strengths of this book is its ability to bring forth historical details about Dr. Sims, revealing a somewhat ordinary existence behind his medical achievements. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that much of the information about Anarcha, Ankey, and Annacay presented is speculative, given the historical marginalization of slaves and the lack of importance attributed to their stories. Despite this limitation, ""Say Anarcha"" holds significant value for researchers and individuals striving to center Black women in their work, offering a meaningful contribution to this important goal.                                      Also, this book delves into HEAVY topics, providing explicit accounts of the horrific abuses endured by slaves. Consequently, it may prove challenging for some readers. However, ""Say Anarcha"" serves as a crucial narrative for those interested in the fields of medicine, public health, and history, as well as anyone with a general curiosity about our collective past.                                      Overall, ""Say Anarcha"" presents an engaging exploration of Dr. J. Marion Sims' life and his impact on modern gynecology, while shedding light on the often-ignored stories of Anarcha, Ankey, and Annacay. Although some information remains speculative due to the historical circumstances, this book is a significant asset for those seeking to center Black women's experiences and contributions. Its weighty content makes it a necessary read for individuals interested in the fields of medicine, public health, and history, as well as those curious about the United States dark past.                                      Huge thanks to Netgalley and Henry Holt publishers for providing me with this digital e-arc in response for my review. I will certainly return to this book for my own academic research.","448 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","A compelling reckoning with the birth of women’s health that illuminates the sacrifices of a young woman who changed the world only to be forgotten by it―until now                              For more than a century, Dr. J.

What J.C. Hallman has accomplished in Say Anarcha is truly astounding. In narrative non-fiction that reads much like a novel, Hallman reveals the truth about the self-promoting liar J. Marion Sims, and finds for all of us a new Anarcha, one of the enslaved teenagers that Sims falsely claimed to have cured of obstetric fistula.                                      Anarcha comes to life in these pages, for the first time, independent of the writings of Sims himself. Not only is the writing gorgeous, but the attention to detail is evident everywhere. I especially love that the illustrated bibliography found at                                       https://anarchaarchive.com/                                      provides such rich detail about sources – at the website, you can click on a phrase found on the pages of the book and instantly pull up images of the source documents, whether it is quotes from the Slave Narratives, an inventory or census record, a diary entry, or countless other documents. It brings this history to life in a vivid and visceral way – you not only imagine these lives and this time – you can actually see them too.                                      This book should be made into a film or mini-series – it paints an incredible portrait of Anarcha and Sims, and of the large cast of characters in their orbit -- of life in the 19th century – you are really there (and the audiobook version is incredible too – great pacing and tremendous voice work from the two actors, who make the book feel very alive).                                      The tale is not just true, it is truly remarkable – Anarcha is almost Forrest Gump-like in the way that she encounters so many people of significance in that time, and that lends to the book’s intrigue and “I can’t put this down” quality. Say Anarcha should be taught in schools – with the bibliography online and the short videos found on YouTube at The Anarcha Archive, the package brings to life years of research and shows you how exciting that research process was and how, in the hands of a gifted writer, a whole world comes alive. There is a reason it is garnering such incredible reviews – Say Anarcha will claim a place in your heart. It did mine.","448 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","A compelling reckoning with the birth of women’s health that illuminates the sacrifices of a young woman who changed the world only to be forgotten by it―until now                              For more than a century, Dr. J.

Knowing more about the women that Sims experimented on is immensely valuable, and I cannot praise that enough. However, the book is unnecessarily bloated with the stories of people tangentially related to the lives of Anarcha and Sims.                                      Anarcha was one of the enslaved women that Dr. Marion Sims experimented on extensively on his path to fame. He has been celebrated as the father of American gynecology, while the enslaved women he performed surgeries on without anesthesia 20 and 30 plus times have been erased from the medical and history books. This is difficult history to recover, but Hallman's extensive work revealed important stories.                                      The book is worth it for the chapters on Anarcha and Sims. The writing here is approachable and perfect for both a wider audience as well as experts. However, I found the focus on comets and celestial bodies completely unnecessary to the story, and there are too many chapters dedicated to detailing the lives of people that, while interesting in their own right, don't add significantly to understanding either Anarcha or Sim.                                      The speculative nature of the history here is necessary, given how little evidence we have of Anarcha or her point of view. The speculative parts were well done. Though as a historian, I would have appreciated more of a discussion of sources and the choices made by Hallman. There are parts where that was done with other people's stories, and it was expertly done, so why not with Anarcha?

Parts of this book are quite graphic, so be warned, but I think making it painful for the reader is important. No discomfort, no uneasiness the reader feels can even remotely compare to what Anarcha was put through, but maybe the reader can better understand what such a life is like. A Black woman, considered property, used with complete and conscious disregard for her pain and suffering by a racist, fame-seeking, mediocre (at best) doctor.                                      This is a long work, and probably could have been as impactful with some of the information cut, but I think putting most of it in the book was necessary. Mainly because many readers won't take the time to look into the material on the website that expands on the project. While some readers will skim or skip parts, you know, because the time to actually read about this woman's life isn't worth it to them, at least it is there for those who care to read.                                      Highly recommended for readers who are interested in medical history, particularly where it intersects with women's and Black history. And for readers who understand just how much history we read is, to some degree, speculative.

Hallman is a very interesting book of speculative fiction (since little was recorded in regards to Anarcha’s life) combined with a thoroughly researched book in regards to the beginning of the medical practices of that time, as well as some of the herbal practices.                                      This was a hard book to read emotionally because of how much pain and suffering was imposed upon people and animals. I did find myself a bit lost too with all the different men (doctors) being mentioned and who they studied under and from which families they came from… but that could also be because I was not really interested in their pedigrees.                                      As a feminist and herbalist, none of the harm that has been done over the centuries by man and his need for power and money was anything that I’m not aware of, but to read step by step how women and medicine men’s knowledge was cut from the world to make room for the modern medical system was very enlightening.                                      I also think this could be an eye opener for many who are not aware of all the pain and suffering that has been (and continues to be) inflicted upon women, people of color, and poor people. But, unfortunately the people who need to read this book, probably won’t.                                      A very heavy read, but one that I encourage everyone to not only read, but recommend to others.","448 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","A compelling reckoning with the birth of women’s health that illuminates the sacrifices of a young woman who changed the world only to be forgotten by it―until now                              For more than a century, Dr. J.

Anarcha was his first ""success,"" except she wasn't and she underwent over 30 procedures, Many other women who were part of this effort died and even if they lived, they were sent right back to their miserable living conditions. This takes some sideways tours through the lives of other surgeons and the socio-economic conditions of the period and at times it's perhaps more graphic (from a medical perspective) than the casual reader might like. That said, you will learn a great deal from this. Thanks to Netgalley for the ARC.

I found it difficult to put down. Anne Hull is an amazing writer. The reader is immediately transmitted to 1960s central Florida- to a place known as The Ridge. Life surrounds the orange groves that cover that part of the state. Her father, a former pesticide salesman, now in the orange juice business, takes Anne with him on his route. (This was her teacher-mother's idea, in order to make sure her dad didn't wind up drinking or in places he should not have been.)                                      We meet Hull's family in all their eccentric glory. Her father grew up on The Ridge in a family of orange growers. Her mother had come from up north with her own mother- a woman who spoke in a foreign accent although she was American. There is also her easy-going brother Dwight, whose name the family decides to change to Jim later in the story.                                      As her coming-of-age story unwinds, Hull takes us back to the 1960s and early 1970s: The Jackson Five, bell bottoms, shopping malls, Tiger Beat Magazine. Her family often struggled financially as they moved around central Florida following her mother's teaching jobs and her father's life in the Groves.                                      As Hull moves through her teen years, she begins to come to terms with her homosexuality, eventually realizing that she would eventually have to leave the Groves in order to live her life as she chose.                                      This is a moving memoir that took me back to my own years in the south in the 1970s. I highly recommend it.

All the while, Hull felt the pressures of girlhood closing in. She dreamed of becoming a traveling salesman who ate in motel coffee shops, accompanied by her baton-twirling babysitter in white boots.

I enjoyed her many stories, especially the ones about her maternal grandmother.                                      [What I liked:]                                      •Anne & her family are interesting people. I was emotionally invested from the beginning, hoping life would work out for Anne, that she would find happiness & the freedom to be herself. I also was rooting for her father, who struggled with alcoholism but wrote her the most touching letters while they were separated.                                      •Anne’s maternal grandmother is absolutely delightful! I loved all of the parts that involved her. She seemed to really enjoy life & just be an all around cool lady.                                      •Reading about the orange industry—the trees, the fruits pickers, the hazardous pesticides, Aunt Dot’s fruit stand, etc.—was fascinating. You really get a feel for the particular time & place from Anne’s descriptions.                                      [What I didn’t like as much:]                                      •Some of the chapters have slightly abrupt endings. The upside is that this keeps the pacing from dragging, but it also left me feeling a bit disoriented over a few of the transitions between chapters.                                      •About 80% of the book covers Anne’s life from age 6 to age 13. The remainder is about her adolescence, discovering her sexuality, her career, her relationship with her parents as an adult, & her parents’ deaths—it just felt like a lot crammed in at the end. Since I enjoyed the first part of the book so much, I would’ve liked to hear more about her adolescent & adult years.

This review is voluntary and opinions are my own. A version of this review also appears                                         on my blog.                                        Through the Groves                                      focuses on author Anne Hull’s early life growing up surrounded by orange groves in central Florida. The book opens with Hull, then around six years old, riding along with her father as he inspects the citrus groves he tends for a juice company. Her mother has created this summer arrangement not for childcare or father-daughter bonding reasons, but to discourage Hull’s father from stopping at the bar on the way home.                                      In addition to this tension, we quickly learn Hull’s parents come from two different worlds. Her father’s family has maintained orange groves in central Florida for generations. Her mother originally hails from New York City. Both of them dreamed of becoming writers, and each wrestles with their own angst and intellectual frustration.                                      Eventually her father’s alcoholism becomes too much, and Hull’s mother takes the children to live with their grandmother in St. Petersburg. During this time Hull takes solace in a bond with her quirky grandmother. She grows increasingly distant from her mother, especially after her mom remarries, pinning her hopes to an unkind man she does not love.                                      Hull, a Pultizer-winning journalist, applies her keen eye for detail to both her inner and outer worlds throughout this book.                                       Through the Groves                                      paints a rich, evocative picture of what it means to grow up rooted in a place that may never accept you. I got a deep sense for Hull’s complex feelings for central Florida. In many ways it made her who she was, and yet the more certain she became about who she was — a tomboy, a lesbian — the less tenable it felt to make a home there.                                      I loved the richness of the landscape and connected deeply with Hull’s writing about it. I grew up in a very different rural landscape but it was no less intoxicating. Hull’s longing to be seen, to experience a fortifying connection with parents who were incapable of providing it, was also very compelling on the page.                                      I struggled a little bit with the end of                                       Through the Groves                                      . Personally, I did not need resolution or closure from every relationship, because in the end this felt like a story about Hull’s relationship with herself. Some of the wrap-up felt unnecessary for my tastes. The ending felt rushed and cluttered compared to the rest of the book. However, this is a minor quibble and other readers may disagree.                                      Overall, I really enjoyed this book. Hull has a knack for transporting the reader into a scene. Her story was heartbreaking at times but in the end hopeful. Even though this story took place decades in the past, its lessons still feel relevant today. Specifically, that we can come out the other side of our youth and find where we fit in the world. It gets better, and we eventually find home.","224 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 20, 2023","A richly evocative coming-of-age memoir set in the Florida orange groves of the 1960s by a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist                              Anne Hull grew up in rural Central Florida, barefoot half the time and running through the orange groves her father’s family had worked for generations.

Initial impression? So enjoyable! Highly recommend! Especially loved that the narrator was the author, it added something to the interpretation.                                      In this short novel, we follow Anne from her preschool days bouncing around in a dirty truck as her father inspects grove after grove of Florida oranges to her adulthood and coming to terms (sort of) with her lesbianism. Her upbringing was unique but also typical. As she describes a neighborhood Easter egg hunt, I immediately recalled my own neighborhood egg hunt and the same requirement of a group photo with all the neighborhood kids. The author engages the reader with a blend of relatable experiences and her own individual ones which are fantastically different and many very “Floridian”…                                      As a resident of the ridge described so well in the book, I loved the descriptions of the land, the people and the general ambiance of central Florida at the time. To this day, if you come to Florida at the right time of year the air smells sickly sweet from orange blossoms and processing.                                      The author leads up to her discovery of her sexuality in a clear straightforward way, but kind of drops the plot in the ending creating kind of an abrupt closure to what had been a leisurely stroll through the memoir. While some of the reviews note that the author comes to terms with Florida not being a place she can be accepted, I didn’t get that from the novel and I suspect that statement is influenced by the current unfortunate state of affairs. Or I may have missed that moment.

I started reading the digital ARC but switched to the audiobook once that was available and boy am I glad I did.                                      As a relatively new transplant to Florida, it's hard to picture the word Hull describes in this book. In the short time I've been here urban sprawl has been disgusting and it was interesting to harken back to a time when Florida was mostly rural. Not that everything was peachy--or should I say citrusy?--then.                                      Through a child's eyes we see how her father, a pesticide salesman, contributed to the declined health of his customers; we see how orange grove owners used to be king; but we also see how some of the bigger problems facing Florida today were beginning to take root.                                      Hull's mother and grandmother were both formidable figures in their own right and feature prominently in the narrative once Hull's father is out of the picture. As does the city of St. Petersburg, a city I've come to love, but wish I knew then.                                      I'm not really sure I would have finished the printed book, but I always love a memoir read by the author so that made the journey more comforting and enjoyable for me. My only complaint, which is a frequent complaint of mine is that the book did not delve enough into being a lesbian during these times.","224 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 20, 2023","A richly evocative coming-of-age memoir set in the Florida orange groves of the 1960s by a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist                              Anne Hull grew up in rural Central Florida, barefoot half the time and running through the orange groves her father’s family had worked for generations.

What I most admired about the writing was the vivid characters. They leapt off the page to the point that even the most flawed among them became endearing. In a way, Through the Groves reminded me of The Glass Castle or Change Me Into Zeus’s Daughter, but set in Florida and with a much less extreme experience of financial insecurity. I did find myself wanting more of a takeaway from the story, perhaps more about the author’s coming out experience in a state largely inhospitable to the LGBTQ+ community, although the author certainly does not owe this to the reader. This was an excellent read and a unique look at a version of Florida I may not have otherwise glimpsed.

This was an interesting memoir based mostly in 1960s Florida. I listened to the audio edition, because I can never resist a book narrated by the author! Anne describes growing up in the orange groves of her home state, and then the increasing difficulties she encountered with relationships and acceptance. I found the ending to be a bit abrupt, with no real ""closure"" moment or lasting revelations, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I wish there had been a deeper dive into sexuality and how being gay in the deep South impacted Anne. Overall, I enjoyed this short memoir and could relate to much of what the author described about Florida, as I spent my childhood summers there.

2023-07-03,To Name the Bigger Lie: A Memoir in Two Stories,,Sarah Viren,3.93,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Queer', 'Essays', 'LGBT', 'Adult', 'Biography Memoir']",Kindle $14.99,Jarrett Neal,Rating 4 out of 5,"June 22, 2023","In my day job I'm an academic at a univeristy, and so is my husband. We and everyone we know who works in higher ed heard about the sinister true-life talek Sarah Viren recounts in this book, whereby she and her wife became victims of a stealth campaign to derail their prospects to secure positions at the University of Michigan. The whole affair was so eerie and bizarre that it had the making of a great Lifetime movie, but it was also scary and enraging. To think that someone would be sick enough to manufacture false claims of sexual harassment just to get a job is almost beyond belief, except for the fact that this happens in real life, and our zeitgeist has become innundated with false narratives, deep fakes, and conspiracy theories to the point that one must be vigilent in pursing the truth.                                      This is the overarching thesis of                                       To Name the Bigger Lie                                      , Viren's attempt to gain control of the narrative of that rending event and also to examine the reasons people buy into conspiracy theories and promote them. Two stories are being told here: in addition to Viren recounting her and her wife's ordeal with ""Jay,"" the scuzzy academic--also queer--who embraked on a course of action to torpedo their professional and personal lives, she also chronicles her high school years spent in a philosophy class taught by ""Dr. Wiles,"" a man who may or may not have bought into conspriacy theores, chiefly Holocoust denialism, and tried to foist these pernicious delusions onto impressionable students.                                      I like the work Viren does in this book but the structure works against it. Meticulous scholar that she is, she goes to great pains to memorialize events and conversations, even enlisting the aid of fact checkers.                                       To Name the Bigger Lie                                      asks readers to connect lots of dots, and it brings to the surface contemporary debates about what curriculum is being taught in schools, the dissimination of harmful beliefs, and the widespread lies that treaten to topple our society. Using the 2016 presidential election as a point of origin for this project, Viren's twin stories prompt readers to ask themselves how they confront and debunk lies and what they would do were they in her place. Though Dr. Wiles's use of Holocaust denialism and other conspriracy theories as teaching tools--quite foolish and pompous, if you ask me--has long-term consquences, Jay's actions could have completely destoryed Viren and her family, and like many readers I want him to pay.                                      But the book tacitly critiques the various systems which enabled Jay's behavior. Not to absolve or excuse his actions, but Jay is a gay man who, at the time, was living in a very converservative and, I gather, a hostie small town in an isolated area. One of the big drawbacks of prusing a career as a college or university instructor is that jobs are scarce and the job market is competitive beyond belief. Jay was obviously desperate to get out of his circumstances and, like Viren and her wife Marta, relocate to a place that was more welcoming to queer people and had more to offer. Yet this by no means absolves him of the damage he caused, and though Viren reports that Jay has since been suffering his own punishment, it's hard not to want him to pay in other ways.                                       To Name the Bigger Lie                                      is compelling up until the final quarter of the book. Once readers reach the Dear Reader section of the book, Viren shifts into imagined dialogues--the one between Socrates and Dr. Wiles at the bar was dumb and embarrassing--Viren begins to tarnish all the good writing that came before. She transitions into philosophical musings and dialogues that I had no interest in whatsoever. That section really doesn't offer anything readers need, so I recommend you skip it all together. She reachers out to Dr. Wiles, they exchange a number of professional emails, and that's it. Other that the eye-rolling final section, please read this book and consider the ways we, both collectively and individually, can uphold truth in a world that values it less and less.","304 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 13, 2023","Part coming-of-age story, part psychological thriller, part philosophical investigation, this unforgettable memoir traces the ramifications of a series of lies that threaten to derail the author’s life—exploring the line between truth and deception, fact and fiction, and reality and conspiracy.

A compelling, incisive journey into honesty and betrayal, this memoir explores the powerful pull of dangerous conspiracy theories and the pliability of personal narratives in a world dominated by hoaxes and fakes.

This book is set to publish in June of 2023.                                      I had to sit a moment and think about the review for this text. While it can certainly be categorized as a memoir, there is a fair bit of philosophical discussion that dominates the text in a way that I believe detracts slightly from the story of Viren's life. The memoir is composed in two parts: first discussing her memory of her experience in Dr. While's class and the second about the sexual harassment allegations made against her spouse and eventually, herself. I had read the New York Times Magazine article that Viren composed in anticipation of this full-length memoir and some of the writing style that I loved in the shorter article did not translate to the longer piece.                                      Since I teach a memoir class, I loved Viren's discussions about the nature of truth, especially in connection to nonfiction. In the wake of ""fake news"" and #MeToo, the nature of what constitutes truth and for whom is something I repeatedly bring up in my classes. As much as this book is a book about truth, it is also very much about teaching. Viren examines her own educational experience as well as her teaching philosophy.                                      While I don't think this is necessarily appropriate for my high school classroom, I would love to see this book in collegiate-level courses, especially for writers of memoir. On the whole, I liked it, but I didn't love it as I expected to after the initial article read.","304 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 13, 2023","Part coming-of-age story, part psychological thriller, part philosophical investigation, this unforgettable memoir traces the ramifications of a series of lies that threaten to derail the author’s life—exploring the line between truth and deception, fact and fiction, and reality and conspiracy.

I expected so much more from this book like scandal, intrigue, and relatable insights. Instead this book reads exactly like what it is, a essay that the author pulled and stretched into a full-length book. There’s not much juice in the high school/coming of age half of the book. The other half is a bit better, but also does not warrant more than an article.                                      Additionally, the book is full of brags from getting into an exclusive high school program to winning awards and mentioning that she was so tired after having her second kid that she could not remember how to pronounce “mimesis”. All the self-aggrandizing detracted from the book as a whole and really turned me off of Viren as an author.                                      Viren apparently teaches “creative non-fiction.” If this is an example of her version of that genre, count me out.","304 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 13, 2023","Part coming-of-age story, part psychological thriller, part philosophical investigation, this unforgettable memoir traces the ramifications of a series of lies that threaten to derail the author’s life—exploring the line between truth and deception, fact and fiction, and reality and conspiracy.

Viren juxtaposes her experience with a high school teacher who pushed his elite students to think and question everything they were taught (in uncomfortable ways, including a discussion suggesting that the Holocaust did not occur as reported) with a horrible experience that she and her wife experienced when they were maligned by a shockingly comprehensive and entirely fictitious sexual harassment complaint made to their current university employer and a prospective university employer. Having been ensnared in the tentacles of online harassment, I could empathize and sympathize with the powerlessness, rage and despair felt by Viren and her wife.

I'm always nervous about giving a memoir less than three stars because it feels like a judgment of the person, not the book. Ms. Viren seems like a nice woman, I don't want to be cruel. And to her credit, ""To Name the Bigger Lie"" is a thought-provoking work.                                      However, some of those thoughts aren't kind.                                      On the positive side, ""To Name"" et al does present an almost-coherent defense of what is colloquially known a ""cancel culture"" (sorry, I can't think of a less pejorative term). In one of the two ""stories"" she discusses a ""beloved"" high school teacher who flirts with Holocaust denial and other dubious ideologies during a few class sessions. I believe the point she's trying to make is that teenagers are vulnerable to recruitment by extremists. Well . . . I knew that. Still, I like the fact that Ms. Viren demonstrates how right-wingers obsess over ""grooming"" and ""indoctrination"" because that's exactly how they attract their own followers. But I wish Ms. Viren could have presented a more compelling case study. She keeps telling us that her former teacher, ""Mr. Whiles"" (cute), is ""charismatic"" but he comes across more like a pompous blowhard who would remind too many teenagers of that loudmouth uncle they're forced to endure at holidays. Plus, none of the kids in Mr. Whiles' class suffer permanent damage. They may listen in silence to Mr. Whiles' loathsome lectures about the decline of civilization, but none of them become Proud Boys. Well, Ms. Viren, you put up with ""Mr. Whiles,"" I put up with Mr. Slick (and no, that's not a pseudonym). Glad we both survived to tell the tale.                                      The other ""story"" got me thinking as well. Unfortunately, those thoughts were some variation on ""why are you telling me this?"" Ms. Viren's wife, a fellow academic, is the target of anonymous sexual harassment allegations, which threatens both spouses' careers. I guess we're supposed to wonder if this is what life would be like in a world where all viewpoints, no matter how extreme or unsubstantiated, are considered equally valid, kind of a ""just asking questions' purgatory. But Ms. Viren winds up demonstrating the truth of Henry Kissinger's oft-quoted aphorism ""The reason that university politics is so vicious is because stakes are so small.""* It's a tawdry tale more fit for a podcast about scammers,** not a memoir that's trying to evoke Hannah Arendt's ""Eichmann in Jerusalem.""                                      So while I'm sure Ms. Viren's life is wonderful, her memoir is half-good.                                      * And yes, there are sources that don't attribute this quote to Kissy-Kiss.                                      ** I can recommend a couple if she's interested.","304 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 13, 2023","Part coming-of-age story, part psychological thriller, part philosophical investigation, this unforgettable memoir traces the ramifications of a series of lies that threaten to derail the author’s life—exploring the line between truth and deception, fact and fiction, and reality and conspiracy.

Or for that matter, that 19 Arab guys conspired to hijack planes and fly them into the Pentagon. Surely by the tenets of modern wisdom, one of those 19 would have let it slip out before the fact??? Ah no, conspiracies are only possible when done by brown people with funny names and scary religions.                                      Other than that - which to be fair, is my main gripe with everything - this isn’t a bad memoir. I’ve certainly read worse. Quite a page turner at times. I really wanted the tea about the accusations against her spouse - and it delivered. Would it surprise you to learn that false accusations of sexual misconduct against a lesbian professor were authored by a man impersonating women online? Now that’s what I call Occam’s Razor, shaves so close it cuts.                                      It doesn’t pass muster to paint JFK researchers and Holocaust revisionists with the same broad brush. There is strong evidence that members of his own cabinet considered JFK a traitor and a communist. High ranking military and intelligence officials were on a streak of assassinations of prominent communists. Whether or not JFK was willing to leave Vietnam or not, the Bay of Pigs showed he was not willing to go along with the program. When “Bombs Away” Curtis LeMay thinks you are a threat to the United States, you die. There were plenty of non communists whose lives were ruined or snuffed out by the same anticommunist forces acting at the time. JFK could have gotten caught up in this; it certainly makes more sense than him getting no-scoped by a “Marxist-Leninist” Marine with a banana-shaped rifle who was then immediately dispatched by yet another Lone Nut. The US government is STILL withholding documents related to this matter. Why? And why does Sarah Viren feel that “JFK” is just another conspiracy theory just like Holocaust revisionism? I would have liked to see her confront the spectrum of conspiratorial beliefs but like many others, she chooses the coward’s way out.","304 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 13, 2023","Part coming-of-age story, part psychological thriller, part philosophical investigation, this unforgettable memoir traces the ramifications of a series of lies that threaten to derail the author’s life—exploring the line between truth and deception, fact and fiction, and reality and conspiracy.

Interesting memoir that starts off with the author's memories of her influential high school philosophy teacher, who taught her and her classmates about all sorts of philosophical issues that wouldn't normally be covered in a typical high school curriculum. At some point, that teacher undergoes a religious conversion and also starts embracing conspiracy theories like Holocaust denial. The second part goes into the author's process for writing this memoir, which is interrupted by a sudden sexual assault allegation against her wife. This part was the part I found most intriguing, as the author does a great job of telling the story of how these false allegations completely disrupted their lives, and how subsequent investigations and developments gradually led to the truth. I also really appreciated the author's discussions about what the truth is, and her honesty about how her own imperfect memory led her to get some details wrong about her classmates. The last part of the book is epistolary in form and goes back to her high school teacher and the author's attempts to get in touch with him and confront him directly about his conspiracy theories. The author is open about her desire for both her former teacher and the person who made false allegations against her wife and later her to confirm what the truth was and apologize for it. While I enjoyed a lot of this memoir, especially the parts about the false sexual assault allegations that had a strong narrative, I got kind of lost in the philosophical aspects, especially with the frequent references to Plato's Allegory of the Cave. I'm just really not into philosophy, so I found the parts that got into the weeds with philosophy were too heavy and boring. But I enjoyed the discussions about truth and memory, and the difficulties in writing nonfiction like this.","304 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 13, 2023","Part coming-of-age story, part psychological thriller, part philosophical investigation, this unforgettable memoir traces the ramifications of a series of lies that threaten to derail the author’s life—exploring the line between truth and deception, fact and fiction, and reality and conspiracy.

A genre blending memoir of past and present. In exchange I offer my honest review.                                      This book is really interesting although I’m not sure I fully appreciated or understood all the philosophical discussions and ideas presented by the author. However, I surely appreciated her perspective on what is truth, how do we defend truth and how do we disprove lies when they are presented as truths. It’s complicated, right?!!                                      Sarah highlights two events in her life, that left an indelible impression causing her to question everything. The first event occurred during her HS days, when a beloved teacher introduced his beliefs of revisionist history. Presenting the denial of the Holocaust as fact, Sarah is traumatized when she finds nobody in her class is shocked or willing to question their teacher. This first exposure alters her views of philosophy, ethics and morals. Years later, when Sarah is married, teaching NF creative writing at a State college, her spouse is falsely accused of inappropriate sexual behavior towards her students putting both Sarah and her partner’s professional lives in jeopardy. Once again, Sarah is forced to reckon with disproving statements of facts as merely lies, falsehoods and conspiracies. I was gripped by the discovery of who was behind the false allegations and how difficult it was for Sarah and her wife to be vindicated.

I might need to stop trying to read memoirs and hoping for a connection. I was hoping that I would get to the part where Gill speaks to her experience of being multiracial, but it started out with too much foundational information about her father's lived experience and it felt much like erasure of her mother. In my experience, my father's existence (indigenous and Iberian-Mexican) paints and colors my identity much more than my mother's (anglo-deutsch-American), and I understand that the history does not feel as rich on my mother's side, but to neglect to shine light on it diminishes what I carry as I walk in the world. Maybe Gill gets to that point later, but it didn't grab me enough to stick around for the end.

Charlotte Gill spends way too much time talking about her father. He is not that interesting. All the mundane things about his life are not fascinating. It was hard to have any empathy for him, too, because he seemed self-centered. Even though his wife was also a working doctor, she was obviously the one who did everything at home, while he did nothing. He even went away on short trips to get away whenever he wanted. His trips eventually led to a divorce and later estrangement with the author, who did not see her father for eight years. She did not contact him and he did not contact her. Why should we spend so much time reading about this man? Because he had such an interesting ethnic background? Well, I guess the book is about being ""almost brown"", as opposed to being ""almost white"".                                      Ms. Gill's British mother married her father in England in the 1960s, where they faced scorn from others. (I do want to thank the author for affirming my beliefs that there is no way interracial couples were so well accepted in British society during the '40s, '50s and '60s, as strangely shown on British TV series that I have watched.) Her mother gets far less attention in the memoir, which only made me want to know so much more about her. The same with the author's younger sister. Was this interest a type of discrimination on my part? Did I want to know more about the white mother and the more white looking daughter because they were white? No, it was more like the little information about them made them seem more “mysterious” in a way. Or maybe I wished Ms. Gill would just stop talking so much about her father . . . and race.                                      It is a book about race, though, isn’t it? That’s the problem with full-length race memoirs, as opposed to essays on the topic. If you don’t think a person’s race is what’s most important about them, your attention can start to wane when there is so much talk about it. You want to know more about individuals as individuals, more about what makes them tick, and how they think and feel about all sorts of things. Things besides race issues. Not that those issues aren’t important. They certainly are for individuals who have faced prejudices and discrimination. Those matters have greatly defined them. Yet I wanted much more from Charlotte Gill’s memoir. I wanted more day-to-day life descriptions, more attention focused on all family members, more humor. I wanted more diversity.

Almost Brown is a hybrid of narrative nonfiction and memoir that explores race through Gill's lens of growing up half English and half Indian, mostly in Canada and the United States. I loved the early chapters of the book, and Gill has a knack for depicting her father (in particular) as a larger than life character. As fascinating as her father is, Gill doesn't shed nearly as much light on the rest of her family (perhaps because her father is the link to her Indian/""almost brown"" roots), to the point that I assumed for a large chunk of the book that her mother had passed away (she had not).                                      Gill does shed light on the history of being biracial, particularly in British societies/colonies, and illuminates many fascinating factoids, such as the history of the term ""mulatto."" She shares personal anecdotes of being questioned about her ethnicity, and professional anecdotes about the expectations to diversify college settings. However, she could have succinctly expressed her views in a handful of essays. Her exchanges with her father become repetitive, as do her discomforts with not fitting in easily in many settings. I wanted to know more about her siblings' experiences and views having grown up in the same family, and less about her father's politics. Gill is an adept writer, though, and I would probably try another book by her.","256 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","An award-winning writer retraces her dysfunctional, biracial, globe-trotting family's journey as she reckons with ethnicity and belonging, diversity and race, and the complexities of life within a multicultural household.

The first part of the book is given over to the conflicted relationships in her family and the history behind their tensions.                                      The title, almost brown, comes from the difficulties she faced as she struggled to find where she fit in. She found information online on how to present a diversity statement in an interview process. The suggestion was to “openly declare one’s own subjective positioning. But I shrink from that task, too. I don’t want to state my race.”                                      Her brother looks like their father but she, favoring her white blonde, blue eyed mother, passes for white. She didn’t want to be given a position because of her race - “I’m not sure I want to be ambiguously, ethnic —just brown enough to pull it off, but sufficiently white to make a good ‘fit.”                                      Her parents marriage collapsed when she was in her teens and then she entered the competitive world of academia. She asks, “What does it mean to be brown? And where does this racial compartment cleave to whiteness?” The bookends of the book are her relationship with her father which was absolutely lovely.

It is interesting that I’ve read this so soon after reading A History of Burning by Janika Oza. Like Oza, Charlotte Gill traces her family back to India - the Punjab in specific - pre-partition… and her family found their way to the UK, and then North America, also by way of East Africa.                                      I thoroughly enjoyed her trip down memory lane. She does a brilliant job of interrogating the past, and assessing her family's experience from a nuanced contemporary lens. I was swept up in her analysis of how the fact of her parents - their personalities and their histories, both individually and together - served to shape her experiences… and lead her on her journey to where she finds herself today.                                      The writing is beautiful - lyrical - and there was lots to like about this…                                      Another must-read title from Charlotte Gill.

This was a bit of a slow read for me, but I enjoyed learning about Gill's unique point of view from the diverse background of her parents, to her nostalgic small town 80s upbringing, to her complicated relationship to her father, to her analysis of race and how its affected her personally. Her writing was visceral and richly detailed—she brought all the senses to life. She dove deep into all kinds of historical context for her background and it really was interesting to find out more about. I appreciated her nuanced perspective and the depth and beauty of her storytelling, even if it got a bit dense sometimes.","256 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","An award-winning writer retraces her dysfunctional, biracial, globe-trotting family's journey as she reckons with ethnicity and belonging, diversity and race, and the complexities of life within a multicultural household.

I wasn’t familiar with her work before reading this book, but the way she breaks down systemic issues like racism, sexism, and toxic fandom — all through the lens of pop culture — is so unique and insightful. This is a deceptively dense read if you allow yourself to really engage with it, and I don’t necessarily think it’s for the casual pop culture enthusiast. Each of the book’s nine essays contain so many ideas that warrant further examination and thought. The essay “Kenny G Gets It” has stuck with me the most so far: it’s discussion of fandom, our expectations of celebrities, and the way the internet has shapes the way we view identity was such a refreshing, honest but never accusatory take on a topic I think about frequently but typically hate reading about. I’m confident Harris could write a master’s level thesis on any one of the ideas she presented in this book and still leave me thoroughly engaged and entertained.

I can spend hours thinking (and talking, if anyone lets me) about the ways strategy has evolved on Survivor or the various histories and influences that go into a single Beyonce costume. But for a long time, pop culture criticism and analogy came from only one perspective - white men at least a generation removed from me.                                      So, reading Aisha Harris’ essays warmed my soul in a way I didn’t know I needed. But it truly moved me to have the same level of merit I’ve seen applied to Bruce Springsteen again and again applied to The Spice Girls. Her essays track her own journey towards self-acceptance through the pop culture she has loved and hated. She dissects everything from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to Zola through a lens of race, gender and millennial angst. Harris has already made a name for herself as one of our smartest cultural critics, and this only cements her voice further.                                      And I may just print out her essay on why she doesn’t want to have kids to hand out whenever I’m asked about it.","288 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 13, 2023","""Aisha Harris is one of our smartest, most entertaining modern cultural critics.

I grew up just a few years after Harris, but felt almost no connection at all to her experiences. Granted, I am white and the first couple chapters at least largely focus on her experiences as a Black woman, so I can only assume this will hit better among a Black audience raised in the 90s. Either way, these essays didn't really warrant the publishing of a whole book in my opinion.","288 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 13, 2023","""Aisha Harris is one of our smartest, most entertaining modern cultural critics.

She is roughly the same age as me and I have enjoyed reexamining the nostalgia of my youth over the years, with (eep) almost twenty years of insight. We don't share all of the references (this is often true since I was mostly just raised on a diet of straight Disney movies but more so as a White girl growing up with little exposure to Black media/pop culture), but there were many references that would have been hard to miss (Spice Girls, Clueless).                                      The book was at its best when it leans into being a memoir -- the opening story regarding Aisha's name and the different stories she had told herself about it was funny, insightful, and a great way to touch on the pervasiveness of pop culture in all our lives. Other times, Wannabe leans more heavily into feeling like several short essays written for an academic paper -- Harris analyzes whether Black culture should be able to criticize itself or should unapologetically back whatever represetation exists in an early chapter. She is wonderful at drawing out the nuances of the debate and also showing how she herself fits into the question as a critic, but there were times when I wanted to hear more about the pop culture at hand.                                      Millenials looking to revisit the 90s and early aughts while also following Harris will find this to be a compelling and engrossing read.

Plus, it was about popular culture, which I have an interest in and appreciation for. Not as deep an interest and appreciation as Aisha Harris's, though.                                        These are personal essays, on subjects personal to Harris, such as her name, that then reach out to connect to the larger world. Now this is significant, because Harris is a young black woman, while I am a not-so-young white woman. We don't share what you'd call a racial culture, but we don't share a generational culture, either. With some of the essays, I felt as if I was doing the reading for a college course, because the information was so new to me. I had to look some stuff up.                                        That's not a complaint, by the way. I found it exciting. I now know that IP refers to ""intellectual property."" One of my son's was surprised to learn I didn't know that. Thank you, Aisha, for catching me up on that. Seriously.                                        The first essay in the collection, relating to Harris's name, Aisha, is a model for the personal essay form she uses. In discussing her own name, she gets into the impact on Black parents of music and the mini-series Roots. Popular culture shaping people. In her case, it didn't shape her name quite the way she thought it did.                                        After reading about her TV interests when she was a girl, I felt bad, because I couldn't remember if my sons had had a similar experience with TV shows. I did monitor the TV a bit here. So I got into that with the same son who was surprised I didn't know what IP meant, and, sure enough, he could recall a Friday night lineup with programs I have little recollection of. Which may get into a generational thing--though I watched TV with my kids, the things they enjoyed were probably pretty meaningless to me, so I don't retain them. I think I only remember Boy Meets World because there was a girl in it named Topanga. Which could lead us back to names.                                        Hmm. Is it meaningful that I was concerned about whether or not my sons had a chance to experience the popular culture of their generation, but I didn't give a thought to what experiences I, myself, had with popular culture growing up?                                        I should have, because I think the big takeaway from this interesting and readable collection is that popular culture didn't just shape Aisha Harris.

I love the podcast Aisha Harris co-hosts on NPR, Pop Culture Happy Hour. All four of the main hosts are fantastic, so I was excited to read Harris's book. I would love for someone closer to my age to write a book like this, because I feel like all I ever read is the millennial perspective, and as a Gen X person, my pop culture memories go way beyond the 90s. Harris's book is definitely more pop culture than memoir, especially in the later essays. A couple of the essays didn't really land for me. In one, she warns you that she's going to give spoilers about a movie, and then she returns to that topic throughout the essay. This is fine on a brief weekly podcast, which I can fast-forward or skip altogether, but I didn't like having to skip the rest of an essay. The other essay that annoyed me was the one about choosing not to have children. I certainly believe it's everyone's prerogative to make these choices, and since I had my first child at 36 and wasn't sure I was going to be a parent, I had to hear all the annoying comments and questions for many years (especially because I'd been married since I was 21). I want everyone to leave everyone else alone about this topic, forever and always, but that includes wanting childfree-by-choice people to stop believing they're superior to people who have chosen parenthood, and Harris is most definitely in that camp. She also includes laughable assertions that she can speak with authority about being a parent because she loves her dogs and because she is a daughter and has parents. Ok.... She also made a point of not liking that people state that they're a parent in their social media profiles. It's hard for me to imagine how anyone could care so much about that choice that they had to tell everyone in a book how much they do not care about it. Even though that essay felt a bit like a trainwreck, the rest of them were quite good!","288 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 13, 2023","""Aisha Harris is one of our smartest, most entertaining modern cultural critics.

I really like listening to Aisha Harris on NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour, and I was excited to read her book. Thanks to Netgalley for the opportunity to read it.                                      I found the book's description a bit misleading. To me, it sounded if this book would be a very personal, fun take on Aisha's views of pop culture and how it shaped her as a Millenial, straight, Black woman. There are a few chapters like that but then it veers into some very serious opinion writing that while interesting, I just couldn't wrap my head around it. Lots of big words and themes I wasn't expecting.                                      I was especially thrown off by her chapter on not wanting children. She seems to have made her decision not to have kids at least in part because of how parents are portrayed in popular culture (stressed, annoyed, unable to truly ""live""). As a mom of two, in fact a stay at home mom by choice, I was really disturbed by her logic. There are many reasons why parents are so stressed these days and it's not because they have bratty kids...lack of good childcare, job markets that take us far from family and community, mental load not being shared between partners and so on. That chapter really left a bad taste in my mouth. That's fine if she doesn't want kids, and I agree that having children is difficult and disruptive, but tying it into pop culture was very questionable and lazy to me. Just like going to a doctor is not like going to Gray's Anatomy.                                      She's obviously a very bright woman who writes well; I just don't think the theme of her book was carried out.","288 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 13, 2023","""Aisha Harris is one of our smartest, most entertaining modern cultural critics.

As we are somewhat similar in age, I found many of the culture timepoints she notes to be quite resonant in my life as well. She also highlights a lot about Black pop cultural moments and how they have affected her and her writing. She weighs the balance of wanting to support Black artists who can struggle to break out while also wanting to be able to critique their work. Some off the chapters are more introspective/memoir-y (her dating history, her decision to not have children, how some pieces she has written have affected her personally), while others read more like cultural critiques (the emphasis on intellectual property in media these days, the trope of the black girl friend over the years in TV/movies). I felt like the book may have come together more cohesively if she focused one way or another. Overall, I appreciated her insights on how culture has affected her life choices and how she interacts with others, and also how these insights have affected her cultural writing through the years. I did not know much about Aisha's background coming into this book (really only knew her from the podcast), so this was lovely.

These essays contain biographical information tied to pop culture consumption as she grew up in the 90s in America as a young Black girl. Harris and I are almost the same age-I think we may have graduated high school in the same year- so a lot of her references to 90s entertainment resonated with me. Even when I had not seen pieces of culture she references (Better Call Saul, etc) she deftly fills in the gaps in my knowledge with quick asides about plot and characterization. Her sheer breadth of references means everyone who has paid attention even a little bit over the past 30 years will have something to latch onto. Also, I didn't know the Santa-Claus-should-be-a-penguin article was her!. I remember the absolutely outrageous reaction some people had to her lighthearted suggestion but never connected the fact that this person I have listened to on Pop Culture Happy Hour for years was the author.

I was surprisingly not familiar with Harris, who is well-known through NPR, Slate, and various podcasts and essays, but I love how her degrees are in theatre and cinema studies. Her knowledge of pop culture is deep and the references excellent. We definitely grew up around the same time period, and though I’m older with a different perspective of mid-90s pop culture, I enjoyed her analyses. And seriously, I love the title and the fact that she states the song’s opening is one of the most classic pop lyrics ever.

Her writing is clear, accessible, and concise, and an incredible amount of research went into this. I also appreciated that Stauffer discussed how the societal push for work-driven ambition affects people differently depending on background, whether that's women, people of color, LBGTQ+ folks, disabled people, low-income communities, folks at a variety of ages and life stages, and more.                                      Something else I really loved about this one: It had tangible solutions for what it would look like for us to rethink our relationships with ambition both as individuals and as communities. So often I'll read nonfiction books that pile on bleak observation after bleak observation, and while it's certainly important not to shy away from certain realities, it can feel incomplete when you get to the end and there's no answer to ""Now what?""

2023-07-03,All the Gold Stars: Reimagining Ambition and the Ways We Strive,,Rainesford Stauffer,4.10,"['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Adult', 'Memoir']",Kindle $15.99,Lenoire,Rating 4 out of 5,"June 24, 2023","All the Gold Stars: Reimagining Ambition by Rainesford Stauffer is about examining our needs and motivation behind our ambitions. The idea of ambition has been woven into Americans’ minds and lifestyles since early childhood for many generations. We are taught as children that having ambition is important for us to be successful or worthy in life.                                      Ambition can be many things to different people. It is that need, the want, and hunger that drives someone to do something. We strive for it at an early stage in life; to get our first “gold star” or recognition for something we did. We celebrate people who hustle and grind, those who are driven, even when they have an unfair advantage compared to others as they achieve their success. We are conditioned to be ambitious and strive for more even when we are burning out or know that our work will never end no matter how much we give.                                      The book reports on how cultural, personal, and societal expectations can shape our ambition and lead to people burning out by tying our personal worth to our productivity. Our ambition can limit our imagination, destroy personal relationships, and degrade our happiness. The author weaves her personal story about her own ambition crisis, along with advice from experts and experiences from others.                                      As the author peels back the layers of outside influences, she shines a light on the effects ambition might have on us. I thought that was interesting and thought-provoking to read. I grew up thinking that if you weren’t ambitious, that you weren’t successful, or were a loser in life. I was a bit hesitant when I first started reading the book because mostly, I found it hard to go against something I was trained to believe was the best course of action for a satisfying and fulfilling life.                                      Each chapter was organized in an easy to digest way. I used the end of each chapter to regroup my thoughts and think about what would be the next steps to end the chain. I realized how easy it is to assume that if someone didn’t have a good job or didn’t get to a certain stage in life at a certain point, that they weren’t successful.                                      I found it relatable to my life experiences: I went to a networking event with a few friends and the first thing people asked was “what we did”, and then I noticed people’s reaction to what other people had said. The networking event was for a hobby of ours that wasn’t related to our everyday work but yet we viewed some people who had certain jobs as more “valuable” than others. I must admit, it was hard not asking a person when you meet them for the first time without asking what they do.                                      I like that the author included stories and experiences from not only professionals but from “ordinary” people. It showcased how ambition is defined and shaped by outside influences. For example, someone from a different socioeconomic background might view starting a business from a hobby one way versus another person from the other end of the spectrum, i.e. an impoverished person might be hesitant to do that because they need a hobby that takes their mind away from the daily grind. The one thing I would have liked was tips on how to combat the need to feel ambitious to the point where it is counter productive. I would have liked to see some activity to help restructure ourselves or ways to put some of her suggestions into practice.","288 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","From journalist and author of An Ordinary Age , an examination, dismantling, and reconstruction of ambition, where burnout is the symptom of our holiest the lonely way we strive.

I love to get and give gold stars and think of them as a sign of a job well done . . . which shows that I am the intended reader of this book.                                      I found this book to be incredibly relatable and think other “achievers” (especially Millennials and/or Enneagram Ones) will too. From the author’s stomach problems to discussion about motivation, ambition, and achievement being metrics of being a good person, I felt seen and understood. I appreciated the author’s examination of how our culture values ambition and a Protestant work ethic . . . and why that is not always a healthy thing. One of the biggest lightbulb moments I had when reading this book was the section on hobbies and how achievers turn their hobbies into “serious leisure” that becomes about achievement rather than enjoyment. I would reread this book and will recommend it to friends who I know will also relate to the message of this book.                                      Cons: None really. I wasn’t interested in some of the case studies, but that is a very minor con.

Even as we burn out. When we can’t even. When we work won’t love us back.                              All the Gold Stars looks at how the cultural, personal, and societal expectations around ambition are driving the burnout epidemic by funneling our worth into productivity, limiting our imaginations, and pushing us further apart. Through the devastating personal narrative of her own ambition crisis, Stauffer discovers the common factors driving us all, peeling back layers of family expectations, capitalism, and self-esteem that dangerously tie up our worth in our output. Interviews with students, parents, workers, psychologists, labor organizers, and more offer a new definition of ambition and the tools to reframe our lives around true success. All the Gold Stars provides ways for us to reject our current reality and reconceive ambition as more collective, imaginative, and rooted in caring for ourselves and each other."

Since then, I have the same standards and emotions towards personal achievement, but have developed more palatable methods of dealing with them. As the target audience for this book on the broken road of ambition and ever-receding benchmarks of success, I recognize that its holistic response to the overachievement treadmill--""the greatest ambition is caring for others""-- is both deeply needed and maddeningly inchoate. (How like a try-hard to want a five-step action plan to free herself from crippling ambition.) Stauffer's examination of work-life balance, the myth of normalcy, and the ideal of relationships and care as central and fulfilling elements of our lives is also a timely addition to the mid-twenties onslaught of career questions.","288 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","From journalist and author of An Ordinary Age , an examination, dismantling, and reconstruction of ambition, where burnout is the symptom of our holiest the lonely way we strive.

This book runs the gamut in terms of subject matter, covering not just ambition, but also mutual aid, communalism, labor organizing, to name a few. It also brings in a impressive number of interviews with experts. Personally, this book resonated with me and helped me put language to some of the amorphous feelings I've had about careerism that common phrases like ""work-life balance"" or ""self-care"" never fully captured.

Stauffer provides evidence as to why ambition is one of the pillars America stands on, both pointing to eras of the past such as the Industrial Revolution as well as various present-day case studies. As a result of this extensive research, she has come to the conclusion that ambition frequently leads to burnout, isolation, and a limited imagination, so she’s setting out to reimagine ambition and the ways in which we strive.                                      This one got off to a bit of slow start for me. The historical analyses of ambition could be very dense at times, causing the information to not sink in and leaving me feeling like I was reading a textbook. But the good news is, by chapter 3, Stauffer hits her stride and it’s smooth sailing from there.                                      This book couldn’t be more timely, relevant, or relatable. It shines the brightest when we hear from the people Stauffer interviewed and when she shares her own experiences. I took away a lot of important lessons that I hope to carry with me moving forward, some of which I’ll list below:                                      •We weren’t made to be isolated beings. We need community and it’s ambitious to care for one another. Don’t be totally reliant on yourself.                                      •People aren’t fooled anymore—work shouldn’t be the center of our lives. We want better from work.                                      •Ambition changes and takes many different forms. Life’s not all about climbing the corporate ladder.

This book focuses on reimagining ambition and the ways we strive. I think some of my disagreements come from my experience as a high school teacher. The time period this author talks about in terms of ambition during her education was the same time period, or very close to the one I grew up in. We were motivated by different things than kids are today. But I think that generation of parents and their experiences has unfortunately made the pendulum swing the other way, and I don’t necessarily think that is good. There are so many kids who are under motivated and need more ambition. That is why I really disagreed with a lot in the first part of the book. I think we do need balance and we need more awareness, but I think sometimes we have too much awareness and it is going to hurt our society, not help it ,at least from what I see from teenagers in the classroom in 2023.

This book. I intended to just download it. I intended to just glance at it. I intended to just read a little, and go back to work. I found I could not stop reading it. I gobbled it up, if not in one sitting, becasue I eventually had to go back to working, at least in one day. Every break, I returned to it, until I had read the entire thing, and wow.                                      Darrin Bell draws editorial cartoons as well as Candorville. By calling this book “The Talk” he refers to the talk that all Black parents have to give their children about how the world looks at them. How they can’t have realistic toy guns. How they can’t assume police are going to be reasonable. He explains it like meeting a rabid dog. You just have to surrender, and hope for the best.                                      This memoir goes from the time he is about six, until today, in this world, where Black people are being murdered by police officers. Where he finds that he has to explain why to his own six year old son, hoping that he can explain better than his dad ever did. His dad, who just wanted to ignore the whole thing.                                      Bell explains that sometimes when he wants to explain something that can’t be explained in an editorial cartoon, he turns to his comic strip.                                      Very moving. Very raw. Very sad. This covers the Rodney King beating, up to the George Floyd murder. Sad bookends. But bright moments as well.

Through evocative illustrations and sharp humor, Bell examines how The Talk shaped intimate and public moments from childhood to adulthood. While coming of age in Los Angeles—and finding a voice through cartooning—Bell becomes painfully aware of being regarded as dangerous by white teachers, neighbors, and police officers and thus of his mortality. Drawing attention to the brutal murders of African Americans and showcasing revealing insights and cartoons along the way, he brings us up to the moment of reckoning when people took to the streets protesting the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.

In this narrative, Darrin uses the metaphor of how a person communicates with a dog in order to show they are not a threat. This example is weaved throughout the novel as a way to understand how terrifying it is when, as a person in a Black body, you feel that you are in harm's way and can experience violence at any unpredictable turn.                                      We read the protagonist's coming of age journey, the way his mother fiercely advocated for him and the way his father failed to teach him certain lessons about being a Black man. At the end of the narrative, the protagonist has his own son and is able to teach him the lessons he had to learn on his own through trial and error.                                      I really enjoyed this graphic novel. It condenses hard to process information in relatable terms that young people will understand while also providing intersecting narratives on what it means to grow up, develop friendships, fall in love, cultivate your professional skills and career, and make meaning out of life's experiences - even the most painful ones.

The page is a never-ending list of black people that were murdered by police and (to a larger extent) white supremacy. The words ""For my sons and daughters"" are highlighted in the middle of that list, making the page into a powerful statement in itself.                                      I loved how vulnerable the author is with his fears during childhood and the years after. I can relate to the parts where his views on racism changes as he grows up. When he's a child, he thinks that his white mother is being paranoid whenever she brings up the fact that he's (half) black and that white society will always see him as a threat, no matter his age.                                      During a group discussion with his white classmates in his undergrad years, there's a really sad and sobering moment where he slowly realizes that his mother was right. No matter how ""good"" of a person he is, America will always see him as a black man. There's no way to escape white supremacy since it's so embedded in American society. It's so powerful that I had to screenshot it. As a WOC, it rings true for me.                                       ""I think I was taken off guard by their asking me questions. Usually these guys reflexively tell me I'm wrong. Or they outright ignore my points (until one of them repeats what I said, as if THEY thought of it.) My hypothesis is that wittingly or not, they see minorities as electromagnetic waves. And they see themselves as the medium through which our experiences, our perspectives, our opinions - and even our PRESENCE - propagate. Everything about us is valid only to the extent that THEY are willing to entertain it.                                        They seem to feel that they're as foundational and as supreme as the Aether.""                                      There's a chapter titled ""The Talk"" where the author has ""the talk"" with his black son about the realities of being black in America.

First of all, it's not a novel at all; it's a memoir in graphic form. It begins when the author was a young boy and encountered large dogs that frightened him. That same fear resurfaced later when he encountered an angry policeman who berated him when he was playing with a water pistol in a public park. Throughout his life, his lighter-skinned brother repeatedly told him that any discrimination or animosity he felt from others was because they were poor, not because they were black. His Black father avoided the issue altogether, and ignored Darrin when he asked about racism. Only his white mother told him the truth directly: white people will not see him in the same way they see a white child; they'll too often perceive him as older, bigger, more threatening. And because he heard this only from his mother, he generally didn't believe her, until many years of microaggressions and outright bigotry showed him just how right she was.                                      I was not aware that Darrin Bell was the first Black cartoonist to win a Pulitzer Prize, but this powerful memoir certainly demonstrates the impact of his work. I love this comment from his acknowledgements at the end of the book: ""As the Prophets would say, 'It is not linear.' I exist in the past where I lived this. I exist in the present where I chronicled it. And I exist in the future, Because one day, when my children and my future grandchildren are grown and have to have The Talk with their own sons and daughters, they can hand them this book.

Content warning for racism.)                                      Born in Los Angeles in 1975, Darrin Bell is the first Black editorial cartoonist to win the Pulitzer Prize, as well as the first Black comic strip creator to have two strips syndicated nationally (Candorville and Rudy Park). He started drawing at a young age - three, at his grandfather's kitchen table - and, while still a student at UC Berkeley, launched a career as a freelance editorial cartoonist. His parents - a Black man and a white Jewish woman - divorced when Derrin was in elementary school, and he was primarily raised by his mother.                                      Bookended by ""the talk"" his Black father failed to have with him at the age of six, and the talk Bell and his wife Makeda had with their oldest son Zazu after the murder of George Floyd, THE TALK is a memoir that examines Bell's experiences as a biracial kid growing up in California in the '80s and '90s. The Challenger explosion, the beating of Rodney King, the 2000 (and 2008 and 2016) elections, 9/11, the kidnapping of Elian Gonzalez, the murder of Trayvon Martin, and, finally, culminating with COVID-19 and lockdown (and how the two helped to catapult the George Floyd protests into the ""Aether"") - Bell touches upon a number of culturally significant moments. (For this Gen X-er, it was like jumping into a time machine.)                                      We also get a glimpse of what it was like for him to experience these moments as a Black man - and, more specifically, a Black man whose job it was to provide cultural commentary by way of political cartoons. When a cartoon drawn hastily in the days following 9/11 is met with pained criticism by Sikh and Muslim readers, Bell decides to stop drawing political cartoons altogether - only to come out of retirement some ten years later, after the murder of Trayvon Martin and the resulting trial of George Zimmerman coincides with the birth of his first child, a son named Zazu. (""I know that if someone like Zimmerman were to one day murder my baby boy, half the country would say my son had it coming."")                                      Bell also interrogates the ""smaller,"" more ""mundane"" microaggressions he endures, particularly as a Black man existing in majority-white spaces. Some of the most satisfying panels are when he calls out his vice principal (who takes credit for ""scaring"" Bell ""straight,"" after a year spent harassing him) and college professor (a liberal white lady who accuses him of plagiarism without a shred of evidence).                                      THE TALK is a powerful and compelling graphic memoir, brimming with memorable panels and                                      penetrating observations. My favorite might be Bell's discussion of electromagnetic waves and the unprovable Aether, and how the latter is an apt metaphor for white supremacy.","352 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Darrin Bell was six years old when his mother told him he couldn’t have a realistic water gun.

These are the issues that they will unfortunately often come across at some point in life. It questions this notion of respectability politics in the Black Community and in a very honest way. It is a wonderful graphic novel that highlights the author's own experiences and uses multiple art expressions to do so.                                      Darrin is six years old when his mom explains to him why she's bought him a green water gun instead of one that's more realistic. She does her best to explain how Black boys do not receive the same considerations as his white counterparts and how police often portray Black children as older and naturally dangerous. For Darrin, it is an encounter with that same water gun and a police officer that opens his eyes to all he fears he will be up against. As the author examines his own journey of how the talk shaped his childhood and how it molded him as an adult it is a reminder that true freedom and equality is a long time coming. As he comes of age in LA and witnesses endless displays of police brutality, he finds his voice through cartooning and as he gets older he learns to use it as a tool of resistance. Learning too that while we've had some progress in race relations, we still have such a long way to go. Drawing on the murders of Trayvon Martin, George Floyd, and Tamir Rice, the author really did a good job of making the strong case for the talk. I also enjoyed navigating his own development as he begins to raise his own son.

This graphic novel memoir begins with Darrin confronting two dogs, which inspires him to carry a rock for protection, and leads to his mother having a discussion with him when he was just six years old about how he wasn't allowed to have a toy water gun that looked like a real gun because of the color of his skin.                                      He grows up having to confront the prejudice and racism that he witnesses while also observing how those around him handle these issues. His brother seems fine with ignorance and avoidance, his mother bulldozes it as soon as she or her children are confronted with it, and his father shuts down emotionally. Through political cartoons, Bell is able to show the ways Americans are still entrenched in racism while exploring his own feelings in how the world views him and anyone else like him.                                      This is such an important memoir, easy to comprehend and powerful because of its medium, and highlights how different it is growing up Black in America. White kids never had to have a talk about race with their parents. White kids look at police officers as protectors rather than threats. Reading this makes my heart hurt and desperately wish things were different, and I hope everyone who reads this feels the same so that change can happen in a big way.                                      Thank you to NetGalley and Henry Holt & Co. for giving me advanced reader access to this title. It publishes on June 6, 2023, and should be required reading for anyone who thinks racism doesn't exist in today's society (well, and even everyone who does tbh).","352 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Darrin Bell was six years old when his mother told him he couldn’t have a realistic water gun.

Born to a white mother and black father, Bell chronicles his life from a pivotal moment when he was 6 years old and first experienced racial profiling and police brutality as a Black boy in America. The racism and discrimination that he experienced from the time he was just 6 years old (!!) continues throughout his life, and ranges from outright racism to hidden racism to subtle discrimination and so much more. This is shown brilliantly through his artistic style as an award winning cartoonist.                                      I went into this book not realizing it was a memoir. I thought it was a fictional book. But it truly wowed me. Not only the message and underlying themes and incredible storytelling, but also the raw, poignant, bleak at times, hopeful at times, point of view that all black boys and men experience.                                      So when do you have ""The Talk"" with your young black son? Is it when he's still in diapers? When he's learning how to pick up a pencil? When he's learning how to read? When he begs for a toy gun and you can't buy him the one he wants because his life is not worth the toy? Is it when he's taking the training wheels off his first bike?                                      For Darrin Bell, he was 6 years old. And towards the end of the book, when his own son turns 6, he and his wife sit him down and tell them the ugly and dangerous reality of this country, and the systemic racism it was built on.

Bell depicts encounters he's had with the police, his continually evolving identity and understandings of race, and key moments in his own life and in recent US history that have shaped him -- including police violence against Rodney King, Trayvon Martin, and George Floyd, elections of Obama and Trump, 9/11, and more.                                      I appreciated the insight from Bell around the balance he felt he had to walk with telling his mom about the injustices he faced and fear of her lashing out at the perpetrators, his frustration with his dad and brother for not sharing their insights on race and discrimination, and the expressions of prejudice and mistrust bombarding him from all angles. I appreciated seeing him finding his voice through cartoons and drawing, and just the glimpse of seeing the critical feedback he received to see his incredible strength and bravery. Watching his evolution from child to man was really powerful, especially through his own words and drawings.                                      I admit some of the discussion of the aether went a little over my head, but it didn't really detract from my experience. A side note that I loved the integration of pop culture throughout the book.

A memoir in graphic/comic format that covers the ups and downs and regular in-betweens of the author's life growing up as a Black boy, adolescent, man, in the United States. This book is not a meditation on race, but like any Black person in the United States, the author's life has been shaped by the outside forces of anti-Black racism and violence and thus, it is a part of his story and his memoir. I loved how personal and individual this story is, while it remains a tool for teaching his audience about the general landscape of our nation. I believe the title reflects this duality: 'The Talk' is a near-universal experience among Black American families and yet, Darrin's 'talk' is actually given to him by his white mom - a 'talk' his Black father prefers to forget, ignore, turn from; a 'talk' his older brother doubts the veracity of, or at least, doubts that racism is its root cause. It is these extremely personal stories and quirks that make this book so brilliant. To have an author say - I became the first cartoonist to win a Pulitzer *and* to admit that one of his cartoons made him the perpetrator of Islamophobia and brought shame to him in the same memoir was so touching. To me, it made the memoir feel more real, more human. And, of course, to see the book end with a reflection on fatherhood and his determination not to repeat his father's mistakes was a tear-shedding moment.","352 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Darrin Bell was six years old when his mother told him he couldn’t have a realistic water gun.

Darrin Bell's graphic memoir is so many things: raw, provocative, angry, soul-crushing, hopeful, and above all, powerful. The illustrations are vivid and evocative, but Bell's words are no less striking. Combined, they tell a memorable, impactful story. Surprisingly for such a heavy-hitting narrative, thre are also a few moments of levity thrown in. (""Mom? Couldn't you at least get dressed before ruining my whole life?"" is the line that made me literally laugh out loud.) Overwhelmingly, though, THE TALK is a serious, heart-wrenching review of Bell's life experiences of growing up as a poor, Black (actually bi-racial, which came with its own set of challenges), shy, traumatized (after a frightening encounter with a police officer at a young age) boy. Even though I only really relate to one of those things, I couldn't help but ache for terrified young Darrin and cheer with him as he found his voice both as a cartoonist and as a person. The ending chapters of THE TALK, which focus on the author's wishes for his children, are especially poignant. They're the ones that probably affected me the most as the white adopted mother of a bi-racial child. Like Bell, I have hope that the issues he addresses can be fixed so that our kids will grow up in a safer, more empathetic, more peaceful world. One step in that direction is to read this timely, important, impactful book.","352 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Darrin Bell was six years old when his mother told him he couldn’t have a realistic water gun.

This novel is not only for teens, but adults should read more than once. It's a graphic novel. It's autobiographical. Darrin Bell is an editorial cartoonist, and he chronicles his life, his fears, and his joys of being a black male growing up in a society where black men are viewed with suspicion and malice. When he was five years old, his white mother told him he couldn't have a water pistol like the other kids had. When she finally gets him one, he's disappointed. It's green plastic and not as realistic as his friends. She explains that black males are targets and he could be hurt. From that point forward, we view his world, as one where he is judged based on the color of his skin.

Drawing attention to the brutal murders of African Americans and showcasing revealing insights and cartoons along the way, he brings us up to the moment of reckoning when people took to the streets protesting the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.

I read a lot about racial equity and social justice, and it was hard to imagine that this format of book could provide something superlative. But oh, it sure did. This was powerful, personal, candid, and ultimately woven together so well that it felt like a work of art. And I’m not even talking yet about its actual visual art, which was striking and highly effective.                                      I was mainly reading this in hopes of sharing it with my graphic-novel-loving older son as a spark for a new discussion about racism. I think he’s too young to get this, though- it feels appropriate for teens through adults, and my sons are 9 and 5. But it will be a conversation starter for us nevertheless, because I can’t resist sharing a few sections with him.                                      It’s richly beautiful, deeply troubling, and ultimately inspiring. I’m so glad I read it, and I highly recommend it.","352 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Darrin Bell was six years old when his mother told him he couldn’t have a realistic water gun.

Starting with childhood in the 80s, we see pivotal points of Bell's life as he grows to adulthood and becomes a father himself. Bell depicts his complicated attitudes towards police, the biases he faced as a student, and the path he took to becoming a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist with honesty and an analytical perspective.                                      The art is deceptively masterful. It moves from a sketchlike quality to crisp inked lines (occasionally using more detailed shadings) to navigate us as readers through flashbacks, daydreams, and the present day with complete clarity. It's a seamless and integral part of the storytelling, which is the highest praise I can give graphic novel artwork.                                      This memoir is both sobering and hopeful, and it leaves white readers like myself with deeper understanding and empathy. This book would be at home on a shelf containing Spiegelman's Maus, Satrapi's Persepolis, Bechdel's Fun Home, or Derf's Kent State.","352 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","Darrin Bell was six years old when his mother told him he couldn’t have a realistic water gun.

Thien Pham did an amazing job illustrating the life of what it is like coming from Vietnam to America. After reading this, I had to message my aunt to find out if she had to stay in a refugee camp before someone sponsored her and she said yes. So, this has opened up more questions to ask my Vietnamese family about their history. I also was able to relate to Thien on feeling ""not Vietnamese enough"". Growing up, it was just my sister, mom, and grandma. I wasn't surrounded by a big family like Linda so my Vietnamese was broken. I was able to understand the language but when it came to speaking it, I had trouble finding the right words I was looking for. I hope that readers will be able to gain a new light on what it is like for immigrants coming to America, because it did for me.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 20, 2023","A moving young adult graphic memoir about a Vietnamese immigrant boy's search for belonging in America, perfect for fans of American Born Chinese and The Best We Could Do !

(audreyapproved),Rating 4 out of 5,"June 20, 2023","Family Style is a touching graphic novel memoir that covers Pham's experience as young Vietnamese refugee in America. In a unique structural choice, each section is organized by a different meal (e.g. banh cuon, ham and cheese croissant, rice ball) that represents a certain time, place and meaning to the author.                                      Perhaps I’m biased because food is a major part of my own relationship with Vietnamese culture (I’m half Vietnamese), but this structure really worked for me.

Wow, what a beautiful book. This was a lovely, intimate story of a Vietnamese family and their journey immigrating to America, told through memories of food. As a person whose love language is food (lol) this really spoke to me. Family Style is told in vignettes across the author's life, centring around his family and friends. I loved the art style and the simple yet impactful narrative voice. The overarching message of the importance of community and having a strong support system was so touching and left me feeling very grateful for mine. I may have shed a tear or two at the frames where Thien's mother made him Bánh Cuón-- being a teenager and trying to balance who you are with your friends and who you are with your family. I think the feeling of being an adult and realizing all the things your parents did for you growing up that you were never quite appreciative enough of is a universal one. This graphic novel really felt like a love letter to Thien's parents and to everyone who makes the decision to leave their life in one country for a better one in another. I will definitely be recommending this one to everyone at work when it comes out.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 20, 2023","A moving young adult graphic memoir about a Vietnamese immigrant boy's search for belonging in America, perfect for fans of American Born Chinese and The Best We Could Do !

His memories of the dangerous boat ride? The saltiness of fish and the sweetness of watermelon. Not the sights or the the sounds, but the foods. The foods that kept his family alive as they were adrift at sea.                                      Once Thien's family arrives in a refugee camp in Thailand, things don't get much easier. They struggle to make ends meet. They believe that making it to California will change things, but it isn't as easy to make it in America as they thought. In each stage of Thien's life, food takes on new meaning. New indulgences and new means for survival. And possibly bringing with it new ways to belong.                                      Thanks to NetGalley and First Second for an advanced copy of Family Style by Thien Pham to review! There have been a slew of graphic novel memoirs being published recently, and so far, they have all been phenomenal. I especially enjoyed that this one was so centered around food, with each stage of Pham's life tied to an important food or dish from that moment. It's a unique way to structure a memoir!                                      Pham captures his family's journey from Vietnam to America through his food journey, focusing on details that I think a lot of people won't necessarily know. The illustration style felt sort of printmaking-esque to me, with so much detail. It also helps in emphasizing the food throughout, showing how they impacted Pham and his family.                                      The little comics included at the end, where Pham asks his family about making this book, are such a great addition to the story. I love when authors include personal little details like that, so definitely don't skip it! It gives even more characterization to his family as well.                                      All in all, this is a strongly written, wonderfully illustrated graphic novel memoir that you should definitely pick up when it comes out in June!","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 20, 2023","A moving young adult graphic memoir about a Vietnamese immigrant boy's search for belonging in America, perfect for fans of American Born Chinese and The Best We Could Do !

In this particular case, it is food which serves to that purpose, making each chapter a small journey towards the meal in particular.                                      Thien’s life has not been easy. His first memories are of fear and hunger in the sea (amazing first pages that take the reader by the throat until they get ashore), of arriving to a new, strange place, of making friends that suddenly disappear in buses to an unknown location. Hist parents only have one thing in mind: the American Dream.                                      Thus, the reader follows Thien in different stages of his life, always guided by the food that he gets to eat. The first time he eats steak he can’t slow himself; the first time he goes to a Vietnamese restaurant once in the States he feels that maybe he is losing his heritage; even strawberries or potato chips have a deeper meaning in his life.                                      There is just one thing that I did not like about this comic, and it was the feeling that it ends too son. I would have been delighted to follow Thien a couple of years more, see how he finds his place in adulthood and which foods were important for him then. I never thought I would be so invested with a ‘link’ in a memoir, but the use of food was the most interesting choice ever.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 20, 2023","A moving young adult graphic memoir about a Vietnamese immigrant boy's search for belonging in America, perfect for fans of American Born Chinese and The Best We Could Do !

Oh, this book deeply moved me. In the search for happiness, belonging and the American dream, even amidst the struggles (of assimilation), one is able to feel the small joys warming one's heart. As different food opens each chapter, it's compelling to see how each meal impacted and meant to Thien's life - the food not only as a survival, but as a memory, a connection to one's own history, to the heritage, to the family; food as a relationship in its own.                                      FAMILY STYLE is about friendship, identity ('to be Vietnamese enough'?) and immigrant experience, which the most simple and immersive art impresses me by the way it draws me into Thien's story. Both tragic and funny, this is a touching graphic memoir that inspires us. Truly precious.                                      note: I would highly pair FAMILY STYLE with THE BEST WE COULD DO by Thi Bui                                      [ I received a complimentary copy from the publisher -                                       First Second                                      .

With each chapter, Thien Pham takes us on the journey of his childhood through his experiences with food.

A powerful representation of family. Thien shared a very personal story beginning with a heart-wrenching depiction of his family's harrowing experiences at sea while immigrating from Vietnam. He shares with his readers some of the many struggles his family faced searching for the ""American dream"". I had the pleasure of attending a panel Thien was on at a library conference. He shared that this book was a long time in the making. I am so happy he found a way to put it all together, I can tell it was written from his heart. Much like myself and (my whole family LOL) food sparks memories for him. He used those memories of certain foods to help his story unfold. I grew up in a small port town with a huge Vietnamese population. I learned a lot about what some Vietnamese immigrants faced and it was truly eye-opening for me.

I think that this would be a wonderful mentor text or springboard for people to think about their own life stories and the different foods that help them remember.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 20, 2023","A moving young adult graphic memoir about a Vietnamese immigrant boy's search for belonging in America, perfect for fans of American Born Chinese and The Best We Could Do !

Imagine finding your safe-place? Where you, for the first time, now have a sense of community and found family? Just to have it all ripped away from you after one night that was filled with tragedy and loss?                                      That’s what happened to Brandon J. Wolf and his friends. The night in question was June 12th, 2016. The location; Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida.                                      Brandon’s life growing up in rural Oregon was difficult. He was surrounded by embedded racism and homophobia, he didn’t feel like he belonged there at all.                                      Then had to deal with the devastating loss of his beloved Mother.                                      He started to spiral out of control, so he moved to Florida for a fresh start. To begin again and to survive.                                      Orlando brought him everything he wanted and needed out of life. A tight knit community of people just like himself - openly and freely themselves. Suddenly it didn’t matter about the colour of his skin or his sexuality, he wasn’t cruelly made to feel like they were holding him back and making him an outsider. He belonged! Everybody deserves to feel this in their lives.                                      He fell in love with a guy called Drew. They figured out over time that it wasn’t a romantic kind of love they felt, it was a truly platonic but soul-mate best friendship. Drew and Brandon supported each other and made each other better.                                      They went out to Pulse nightclub that one June night, like many other nights before, to dance the night away surrounded by their type of people. They were with their significant others, Drew with Juan and Brandon with Eric. Brandon and Eric went to the toilets and as they were chatting, their life as they knew was about to change in a big way…                                       bang, bang bang                                      What was that noise? Something going wrong with the sound system…? Then it dawned on them. Gunshots. In a place that felt like home. It was being invaded and now they have to fight to make it out of there. To survive. How is this fair?                                      Brandon and Eric managed to make it outside, but as the fresh air hit them and they ran away from the scene of carnage, they realised something truly heartbreaking… Drew and Juan were still inside.                                      This is one of the most moving, powerful and important memoirs I’ve ever read. So glad I chose it as my                                       Amazon First Reads                                      book for June.                                      Mass shootings in America are an epidemic, so many young people are needlessly losing their lives. I implore you all to give Brandon’s story a read. It’s about finding the strength to carry on after unimaginable pain and loss.                                       ”Drew and Juan didn't just matter because of the brutal way they were murdered; they mattered because of the beautiful ways they had lived. The love they had shared with us- -and for each other--was worth shouting out loud. The community they had created, for anyone lucky enough to know them, was worth memorializing.”                                      🏳️‍🌈❤️","222 pages, Kindle Edition                             First published June 6, 2023","From one of the most vital and passionate LGBTQ+ activists comes a powerful memoir about self-discovery, community, love, and resilience in the face of adversity.                               You never forget your first. First kiss. First love. First heartache. They all burrow their way into your subconscious, destined to reshape how you see the world forever.                              Growing up in rural Oregon, Brandon Wolf grappled with the devastating loss of his supportive mother and with the embedded racism and homophobia of a community that made him feel like an unwelcome stranger. After the lack of connection and role models led him down a spiral of risky behavior, Wolf escaped to survive. In Orlando, he found what he’d been searching for: belonging—in a community that was a safe space with people he’d come to call his chosen family. They taught Wolf how to love, and be loved, unconditionally. Then, on June 12, 2016, in an exhilarating refuge where Wolf and hundreds of others had discovered a liberating new normal, they were suddenly challenged with fighting for a way out—in order to survive. Overnight, everything was ripped away by chaos, panic, and fear. But the unimaginable tragedy also gave Wolf a new power: purpose.                              In this unforgettable coming-of-age memoir, Wolf shares his transformative journey from young outsider to galvanizing activist. Marshaling the compassion and strength of a community, Wolf explores how to get through the darkest times with healing, hope, and resistance. “With our backs against the wall,” he writes, “we find a way out together.”"

Wolf,4.34,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Adult']",Kindle Unlimited $0.00,Liralen,Rating 4 out of 5,"December 23, 2022","Wolf survived the Orlando nightclub shooting, but that's not where he starts the story: he opens the book in his childhood in Oregon, when he lost his mother at a young age. This would be a devastating and formative loss for almost any child, but for Wolf it came with an extra complication—he already felt                                       other                                      , and without his mother by his side it was a long, long time before he could truly feel that he had people in his corner, people who understood him.                                      It's roughly a third of the book in before Pulse is even mentioned, and that's intentional: the shooting was the catalyst for this book and a catalyst in Wolf's life, but it was representative of a great deal more than that. Wolf describes growing up knowing exactly how many other students in his school were Black, knowing that his white family wouldn't stand up against racial or homophobic slurs, and constantly needing to watch his back, because his school and his town were not safe places to be if you were different. (That Pulse was something representative of a safe space—and of chosen family—is not a new spin, and if you've read a think piece or two this won't come as new information. But Wolf doesn't belabour the point about Pulse here, focusing instead on the people who were his chosen family.)                                      I'm grateful that the book focuses less on                                       what happened and who committed this violence                                      and more on                                       who and what were lost                                      , because Wolf is right: the media conversation so quickly turns to othering and blame. Thoughts and prayers. The human stories get lost, and nothing changes. That said, on the subject of the media, not long before I read this (in December 2022), the                                       New York Times                                      reported that gun violence had become the                                       leading cause of death                                      for children in the U.S., surpassing motor vehicle crashes, cancer, and other causes for the first time. The Orlando victims didn't include children, but this book is still incredibly timely. Shootings have gone up, not down, and there have been so many mass murders that they blur together even when I look them up individually. (Tell me there is a systemic problem without telling me there is a systemic problem.)                                      This hovers somewhere between three and four stars for me. The story and timeline felt clearest in the first two thirds, and the writing sometimes felt unnecessarily dramatic—the material is dramatic enough not to need the flourishes. But I'm also reading this thinking                                       why is this the first memoir about this that I've seen?                                      Surely there have been others—it's been more than six years. But the people affected by this shooting tended to be in doubly marginalised groups (in many cases queer and Latinx; Wolf is queer and Black), and those aren't voices that are often amplified in the US. It's appalling that there is even a mass-shooting literature, but...there is, and Wolf's is a necessary voice in that literature.

Judging by his writing, he is also intelligent, funny, shy and brutally honest. Thank goodness, there are places like Pulse Nightclub where he could go to unashamedly be himself, a place he could call his own, a safe haven. Until the unspeakable happened.                                      Brandon survived the horrific, traumatic event, but he lost his best friend, Drew, and other friends in the shooting. After a period of grief, he turned to activism in the hopes of preventing this sort of tragedy from ever happening again. We should all be sickened and infuriated by our politicians’ selfish needs for reelection rather than actually enacting any useful gun legislation, and he set about trying to change that through activism and advocating for change himself.                                      This isn’t a story that only encompasses the Pulse Nightclub tragedy. It is also about racism, homophobia, inequality, mass shootings that continuously fail to yield any meaningful laws, and the injustices endured by anyone who is perceived as different. Our country is divided and our humanity endangered, and it needs to stop. In writing this book, Brandon not only wants to memorialize his friends, Drew and Juan, but he wants to shine a light on the victims rather than the terrorist. And in doing so, I hope he’s been able to assuage his survivor’s guilt and show the world that love is love.                                      I give this book 4 stars and applaud the author for his vulnerability in writing his memoir.

But for people like me, people navigating the perilous crossroads of identity, safe spaces are shelters in a dangerous reality. They’re carefully crafted hideouts we carve for ourselves, sacred cubbyholes hidden from the harsh glare of a violent world that wants to devalue us.”                                      The author grew up in a small town in Oregon, a biracial child who was targeted for the color of his skin and sensitivity during his school years. His mother was his greatest supporter while his stepfather was the opposite. When his mother died from cancer and feeling misunderstood and ostracized by his community (even though he had not officially come out as gay publicly), he packed up and moved to Florida. He worked at Starbucks and then transitioned to being a character at Disney World. Adjusting to the independent life coupled with a terrifying encounter of racial profiling by the local police left him questioning his life opportunities. However, he eventually discovered life-affirming friendships with other queer people and settled into a more comfortable life. His best friend Drew helped draw the author out of his shell and start to both appreciate and enjoy the life he was establishing. One fateful night, he and his friends went to the Pulse night club in Orlando, where his life would shatter again where a lone gunman killed Drew and dozens of other club attendees. Feeling profound fear and guilt for having survived the massacre and having initiated the invitation to come to Pulse that night, he struggled mightily. Yet, he was able to adjust the context of this horrific act into activism for those in the queer community. He established the Dru Project in honor of his deceased friend, a group dedicated to creating safe spaces for all queer youth.                                      This heartfelt book will appeal not only to LGBTQ+ readers, but to anyone committed to the fight for social justice for any marginalized community. A poignant, inspiring, sincere, genuine, and meaningful look at how the author was able to find his purpose as an advocate and activist and move forward in life. It should be noted that I had no idea he was part of the Pulse situation, which made the revelation that much more shocking.

Brandon starts the novel off by detailing his growing up and the early experiences he went to that began to shape the person he is today. It was tough reading a few of his memories from dealing with his mother's death then to an assault. He had to grow up with the struggles of racism and homophobia and I empathized with him. Mid-way through the book he journeys to Orlando and there is the hope of his life getting better and you see the light shine on him through the wonderful friendships he develops. His finding of a community and love from others gives others hope. Then there is the tragic night of the Pulse Shooting that was quite rough to read through. It is a necessary story to tell and I was quite impressed by how he did self-realization leading through personal forgiveness. I cannot imagine those emotions he had to go through dealing with guilt and loss. He is such an amazing person and his moving speeches and interviews give hope for a better future. The story had a general structure through divided parts, but each chapter occasionally had short stories out of order. I had to rewind my mind to remember what year it was through the jumping back and forth. It was the perfect read for Pride Month and while I had already preordered the hard copy, I rushed to read it once it was on Amazon First Reads.                                      4.5","222 pages, Kindle Edition                             First published June 6, 2023","From one of the most vital and passionate LGBTQ+ activists comes a powerful memoir about self-discovery, community, love, and resilience in the face of adversity.

Though, I know it is necessary for the book and for those deciding whether or not to read it, so, if any book deserves above and beyond 5 stars it is this one given that it is a story I will never forget. I would also add that if you are deciding whether or not to read this book in particular, definitely read it. A Place for Us is a must read, though, sad and heartbreaking in a way that had me crying more often than not.

I am so thankful that I had the opportunity to read it. Growing up in Central Florida, I knew a lot about Orlando, and paid particular attention to the news when the Pulse Night Club attack happened. Another needless tragedy to a people who didn't deserve it, by someone evil in intentions and actions. However, living so far from Orlando now, I didn't follow the story for long since there always seems to be another story coming right behind.                                      Through his personal experiences both before, during and after the tragedy, Brandon is able to bring us all into the event. I say this a lot about the books I read, but reading books by people that aren't in your social circles or about groups to which you don't belong can help you understand their views of the world so much better. I am not black. I am not gay. I have never been through a tragedy such as this, but reading Brandon's story can help me empathize in a way just watching the news or reading articles on the internet never will.                                      I highly recommend this book for everyone. It is not overly political, nor does it try and tell anyone what to do or how to think. Brandon just tells his story, from his perspective. He is real, and vulnerable, and exactly the person we should be listening to about this particular event.","222 pages, Kindle Edition                             First published June 6, 2023","From one of the most vital and passionate LGBTQ+ activists comes a powerful memoir about self-discovery, community, love, and resilience in the face of adversity.

I could not put this book down. I found myself liking him very, very much. He is sincere and honest and has a very unique talent of drawing you directly into his heart. I'm not usually a fan of memoirs, but this one completely blindsided me. It is brilliant.                                      On a personal note, I found myself feeling a bit hopeless when finished. I'm white, somewhat conservative, Christian, and live in the Midwest. As much as I like Mr. Wolf, I fear he would immediately call me enemy. I wish that as a country, we would stop labeling people, assuming everyone is the same, and hating those we don't agree with. White men aren't all bad. Republicans aren't all racist. Police aren't all brutal. Until we stop looking at groups of people as a whole and start making individuals answer for their evils, we have no chance of being united. I hope someday Mr. Wolf will see us all as individuals and not as this party or that race. He was able to do that with the Muslim religion, and it touched me. He then immediately went on to blame white media for verbally attacking Muslims. Not media in general, just white media. Our country is a mess, and it just makes me feel hopeless. Our government and media encourage this divide, and we fall right in line. Peace to all, and may we all learn how to love better.","222 pages, Kindle Edition                             First published June 6, 2023","From one of the most vital and passionate LGBTQ+ activists comes a powerful memoir about self-discovery, community, love, and resilience in the face of adversity.

I chose it because I find memoirs interesting and I was interested to read the memoir of a member of an oft excluded background. I had not heard of the tragedy at Pulse before reading this. I may well of seen it pop up in the news at the time, but to be brutally honest, as a European, news from the US seems to just cause an eye roll and a sigh and doesn't register much on a lot of our radars. I found Brandon's writing about his loss of his mother, his problems with fitting in, regardless of what he did - too black, not black enough, too gay, etc very heart rendering. I enjoyed his style of writing and how he explained things. When he got to the part of the mass shooting, his reactions and life after that, very moving - though some of it did seem to be get a bit disjointed at times. However I particularly liked his writing about his feelings of guilt, having to prove to himself that he deserved to be happy, hanging on to feelings of not deserving to be happy and finally coming to terms with having to forgive himself and others. I felt this was very powerful and something, I suspect haunt so many people.

That was also my introduction to Caroline, and I have no shame in admitting I’ve been quietly watching her story continue to unfold on the internet (CC memoir update: still nonexistent.)                                      I also kept an eye on Natalie; I found her Cut essay really captured the messy experience of complicated friendship in a really beautiful way. So when I saw she was publishing a collection of essays, I was hype!                                      Adult Drama is a gritty look at surviving your twenties, and what exactly it means to reach adulthood. I’m about the same age as Beach, so a lot of her musings really struck a chord. Each essay follows a similar structure: an overall thematic idea, with (sometimes meandering) bits of her lived experienced woven together with bits of related pop culture history. Sometimes the meandering is a little too much, but most of the time I loved the way she connected ideas. The memoir ends with a second essay reflecting back on her relationship with Caroline, and I thought it was brilliant to come full circle like that; I also think this particular essay is perhaps even stronger than the one on The Cut because it explores more of her mindset surrounding the entire situation.                                      Overall, I really enjoyed reading this collection and will absolutely read more from Beach in the future. If you enjoy memoirs, this will likely be a great read for you.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 20, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated Book in...

While there is one new essay about said relationship it wasn’t my favorite in the book by a long shot.                                      I think Beach explained herself why this collection works as well for me as it does when she relayed one of her former professors’ critique of her writing, “what you’re limited by right now is where you’ve walked through yourself.” While Beach is still limited by what she's been through all these years later, my favorite moments in this book are ones where Beach is observing others, whether her mother-in-law in the hospital, a quirky roommate, to protestors outside of Planned Parenthood.                                      My two favorite pieces in the book were:                                      — Abortion, Abortion, Abortion. Beach walks us through her time as a patient escort at Planned Parenthood through second person. By removing herself entirely from the essay, we get one of the most self reflective pieces in the entire work.                                      — Dead People’s Stuff. As a fellow estate sale enthusiast there are lines in this essay I will remember at every sale I go to from now on.                                      This book isn’t perfect by any means: there is very little flow to the collection, some of the stories tend to drag on, and despite the title being “Adult Drama” and Beach lamenting about the abundance of coming of age stories, the bulk of this collection exists in Beach’s early twenties / college years. That being said I thoroughly enjoyed reading this and look forward to seeing Beach’s writing advance in future publications.

I think Natalie's voice and personality come through these pages beautifully, even when she's writing about subjects farther from her personal experience. I particularly enjoyed the essays about her many odd jobs and ""mangled resume,"" and ""Abortion Abortion Abortion"" is the clear standout for me. For scholars of Caroline Calloway, there are a few juicy tidbits, but I mostly appreciated the perspective that Natalie offered on their friendship. Friendship breakups can be soul- and identity-destroying, and she captured that mid-twenties anxiety well.                                      Part of me feels the collection could've benefitted with a few more years of life experience for Natalie. Memoirists are limited by what they've lived through, after all, and a few more years to turn into writing material could've made this an overall stronger piece of work. I also thought her perspective was limited in some places but especially as it related to privilege and gentrification. And even an additional few months of editing could've fixed some spots I found the writing clunky. At the same time, though, Natalie openly admits to capitalizing on her own virality, a strategy that's sure to have diminishing returns. I admire her ability to leverage her previous bad experiences with Calloway to launch a writing career that is, from where I sit, a laudable debut.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 20, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated Book in...

Beach has a natural way with words and especially wonderful single lines; there are so many places to pause while reading and underline a sentence. The book feels worked on and carefully crafted. There's also a lot of empathy for all of the characters on the page, and a humor that helps lighten up the heavier subjects. Several essays in the book directly involve Caroline Calloway; the second and the last come to mind right away. They're definitely interesting, and arguably part of the reason this book exists at all, especially with a major publisher. That's not a knock at Beach at all; it's very hard to publish a memoir or essay collection if no one knows who you are, regardless of talent. That said, the essays in here that don't involve Caroline are smart, beautifully written, and include a healthy blend of cultural criticism.                                      The first essay in the collection still stands out to me; it's puberty and playing sports and Abercrombie and low-rise jeans. It's a great example of a well-constructed essay; I can imagine people teaching it in a workshop. Some essays kept my attention less, but overall, this is a very nicely put together collection that covers the Caroline storyline without letting it saturate the book. I'm so curious about if CC will ever actually publish her memoir, and if so, how they'll read together.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 20, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated Book in...

I thought this was a good book of essays that show someone truly challenging themselves to become a better person despite some of their worst instincts. Because of my knowledge of the Callowayverse, it was especially interesting to see how much more alike the two of them come across in writing than I would have guessed.                                      In particular, the Callowayesque part and the biggest weakness in these essays is a persistant habit of not quite exaggerating, but emphasizing the unusual details in a story. It comes across as a little try-hard, like the person who wants to have the reputation ""the craziest stuff always happens to you!"" It's an over-reliance on zaniness that cheapens otherwise very thoughtful work.                                      Nonetheless, I enjoyed these. She's not yet at the level of other essayists who write dense, referential, meandering essays (your Jia Tolentinos, for example). But they were really solid.

Her reaction to outing Caroline Calloway's suicidal ideation?                                      ""I didn’t come here to make friends.""                                      Yep. Seriously. I don't like Caroline Calloway, but being unremorseful about outing someone's private mental health struggles is just ugly. I don't really want to spend time in the head of someone who feels entitled to publicly reveal someone contemplated suicide.                                      Beach is by her own admission nebbish, and she seems determined to make that the world's problem. Her victim complex, her bitterness, and her resentment are all blistering, and though these traits could be compelling in a girl-blogger, Black Swan, Ottessa Moshfegh kind of way, her sense of entitlement strips away anything interesting about her unsympathetic personality. She's the kind of girl who, when caught speeding, says, ""Well, everyone else was speeding."" To which the police officer replies, ""Worry about yourself.""

That being said, I was very curious as to what I missed and was interested in learning about their connection as well as what the author had to say in her other essays (most of which do not touch on the Calloway issues).                                      I think the author is a talented writer, and I enjoyed many of the essays, particularly the estate sale one. I also found the Calloway essays fascinating. The essays felt a bit disjointed though. This was a quick read, and I'd recommend to readers interested in the Calloway story. The author had many interesting things to say, and this was a solid collection of essays. I don't have a whole bunch in common with the author, but her book was an interesting dive into a world I somehow knew nothing about.

Adult Drama by Natalie Beach was interesting, but it didn't grab my attention like I wanted it to. I think I am not ready yet to read memoirs of people who are super close to me in age. A lot of what Natalie wrote about was relatable, but I think I was looking for a more cohesive flow through the various essays. I never felt super connected to Natalie and I feel like that was what I was searching for.

Funny, clever, and dykey, this book was everything my soul needed.                                      What I appreciated most about this book was the casual nature that discussion points were brought up, not trying to have all the answers, not trying to be academic, not trying to be perfect, just spinning the little wheels in my brain. After nearly every chapter, I'd pull up a chair with my fellow lesbian friends and say ""So this book I've been reading brought up something really interesting..."" I could have finished the book a week earlier if I hadn't spent so long talking about the book!                                      Particularly, I had lots of discussions about what does it mean for queer spaces to evolve and be more inclusive? Why have several gay men's bars NOT been doing that, and why do non-cis gay men get such terrible service at those bars? (The stories I could tell, going to gay men's bars as a lesbian lmfao) How have labels changed and adapted? What does it mean to actually be ""queer presenting"" and how are their pros and cons of obvious queer flagging and then being suspicious of those who don’t look ""queer enough."" How do I seek community in my own life? What's my relationship with the queer elders in my life? What do I want my relationship to queer community to look like? What's our history that I've never had the chance to learn? Like seriously, every chapter of this book had the little wheels in my head spinning.                                      I don't know that I can properly string together words to describe how much this book meant to me, the ways it hooked into my chest. But I can say that reading this book made me feel more connected to my community than I have in a very long time, and encouraged me to go out and seek community in my city. It made me want to make more of an effort to go to the lesbian bars when I visit other cities! It just... I don't know! Made me feel a little less alone. Maybe the real queer community was the journey all along the way or something. I'm going to hold this book very close to my chest for a very long time.","320 pages, ebook                             First published June 6, 2023","A former                                 Rookie                                contributor and creator of the popular blog                                 Effing Dykes                                investigates the disappearance of America’s lesbian bars by visiting the last few in existence.

A book following a woman visiting all the last remaining lesbian bars across the US and looking into why so many of them have closed over the years really appealed to me. But I ended up not being totally enthralled with the book as a whole.                                      I loved getting a look at the different lesbian bars throughout the country. The way Krista described their décor, ambiance, and overall vibe was extremely impactful. The parts of the book I loved the most were when she was actually able to interview the bar owners or have in-depth discussions with people about the changing landscape of lesbian bars over the years. There’s an interesting situation where people want to be inclusive and welcome all types of people into the bars, but then that seems like it's erasing the history of the bar as a lesbian bar. I do appreciate that Krista makes it clear that she doesn’t support any transphobic nonsense when it comes to discussions of who is or is not welcome in lesbian spaces.                                      However, as the book went on it started to feel a bit repetitive. Even though she was interviewing different people in different bars, a lot of their answers felt pretty surface level and samey. But then again it’s probably difficult to have an in-depth interview with someone inside a bar on a busy night on the weekend. I feel like there could’ve been improvements to the overall interviews if people were contacted again later away from the bar to be able to get deeper responses.                                      The way that Krista shared her own history with lesbian bars, her story about coming out to her parents, and the struggles she had with her sexuality because of being raised Mormon added a lot to the book. I still think this is a worthwhile read, it’s interesting to see the different types of bars in different locations. As well as the various types of interactions Krista had with people throughout her travels. I’d be open to reading more from her in the future. There were definitely portions of this that were great, even though it didn’t become a new favorite.

I've been in a very small handful of lesbian bars, and a number of non-queer bars that is large only in proportion to the number of lesbian bars I've been to, and when                                       I                                      was younger my queer community was centered more around, like, book clubs. (This will surprise literally nobody who has ever met me.) But then I realised that Burton was the writer of Effing Dykes back in the day, and                                       holy moly let me at that book                                      . I kept Effing Dykes in my blog feed for                                       years                                      after it went dormant, because you never knew! She could post again! And I didn't want to miss it just because I was fool enough to unsubscribe!                                      So                                       Moby Dyke                                      does not disappoint, partly because it's both entertaining and thoughtful on its own but also partly because part of me is still stuck ten years ago, double-checking links in vain hope of updates. Burton spent the better part of a year juggling her weekends and PTO in order to traverse the country, visiting dyke bar after dyke bar and asking: why are there so few of them left? How does the community feel in an era when being queer is more accepted, but also in a not-quite-post-pandemic time? And what does it mean, in this day and age, for a bar to be a lesbian bar in the first place?                                      Burton doesn't play favorites, but I'd be curious to know which bar she most wished were in her neighborhood (and why)—and also whether they started to run together for her by the end. (They did for me, but since I was 90% in it for the conversations and commentary anyway, I can't say that I was bothered. I might have minded more had I been planning to relocate to a specific town in the US based on proximity to a good lesbian bar and was using this book as my sole reference, but that's not me, and...I don't think that's going to be very many people.) I'd also desperately like to know why there were apparently no lesbian bars in Provincetown, because you cannot tell me that P-Town has lost its status as the lesbian San Francisco or I will slowly melt into a puddle of grief.                                      Please go buy this book so that the publisher will give Burton a contract to write another book. I don't know what it's going to be about, but I want to read it.

2023-07-03,Moby Dyke: An Obsessive Quest to Track Down the Last Remaining Lesbian Bars in America,,Krista Burton,4.14,"['Nonfiction', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Lesbian', 'Queer Lit']",Buy on Amazon,ReedingThroughTheYear Reed,Rating 5 out of 5,"March 22, 2023","I am writing this review through honest-to-God-tears, after having stared blankly at the last line of this book and my kindle screen for five minutes.                                      This book was enthralling. I came to this book — as a lesbian, as someone who lives in Chicago, and is friends with two of the lesbian bar owners here — with my own pre-conceived notions about lesbian spaces. Krista Burton’s Moby Dyke affirmed some notions, dispelled and challenged others.                                      Moby Dyke invited and welcomed me into all of these diverse yet universal queer spaces around the country in such a way that I became addicted. I devoured this book in two days. I laughed along with her witty repertoire of insights throughout, yet also found myself crying at some of the more tender parts of this work.                                      As a woman who left Christian extremism (and a religion, who as Krista so eloquently stated, was more cult-like than not), leaving behind a family system that often feels like a gaping wound, those moments of personal disclosure around the writer’s own family dynamic felt particularly poignant.                                      Who gets to access spaces meant for lesbians and queer individuals? What does “all are welcome” truly mean and how do we keep these spaces safe for those that have so few spaces left? I am not sure this book answers this as I’m not sure there is a byline there to give. The closest it comes is this passage that was particularly affirming for me:                                      “It is a lesbian bar. To not call this a lesbian bar does a disservice to the reason the bar was created. This bar was built decades ago to be a safe space for lesbians. This is not a gay bar. This is a lesbian bar, and to ignore that is erasure.”                                      I felt it encapsulated what I want the answer to be — that being inclusive and welcoming to other identities does not mean we forget the need for lesbian community. It’s history, the fight for visibility, and belonging. Or, the ways in which lesbian women, both white and in particular lesbians of color, are treated currently, even by our sibling identities within the LGBTQIA community.                                      Let’s just say I have a few lesbian bars added to my travel wish list. I was additionally delighted to read of all the lesbian bar openings that were announced in the epilogue. How hopeful — and important. Which, is how I feel about this book. It is ultimately, so hopeful and important.

The author decides to go on a giant road trip across the US to visit all of the remaining lesbian bars, interview the owners and customers, and generally just see the vibe of each one. It was fascinating to learn about the similarities and differences between the bars and I found myself googling images of them so I could imagine where she was in each chapter. This isn’t a queer history book, it’s a queer present day book, and it captures little moments around the country. While it’s mostly travel nonfiction, the author also mixes in a little bit of memoir and tells bits and pieces of her life story. She’s an exmormon lesbian married to a trans man, and you get to know more about their relationship as well as the author’s experience coming out in a religious family. I thought that there was a good balance between the traveling and the memoir-ing!

She treats other states almost like they’re foreign countries, curious about cultural differences and the dialects, fashions, and foods found across regions.                                      She also goes to many of the bars with her spouse Davin Sokup, who incidentally became Minnesota’s first trans man elected into office this year. Together they’re able to explore the complexity—and increasing inclusivity—of queer spaces today.                                      And that’s what this is: a fun, light, and airy exploration. Krista doesn’t dig too deep into questions like “Why are lesbian bars always inclusive when gay bars are just gay bars?” or “Why have lesbian bars become critically endangered?” This is not an academic text, never poking beyond the conversations she has over drinks at crowded bars on Saturday nights. Yet somehow, Krista’s experiences start to paint a bigger picture.                                      Lesbian bars rose up in response to the exclusivity of traditional gay bars. They’re the spaces for everyone else queer. And while they are decreasing—likely for a multitude of reasons, ranging from increased societal acceptance to Trump era politics—there is also a renewed spotlight on their plight. Campaigns like the Lesbian Bar Project have made folks consider:                                       Do we still need lesbian bars? Do we still want them?                                      The answer is a resounding                                       yes,                                      and more queer-inclusive spaces continue to open up across the country.                                      Sadly, the single Black-owned lesbian bar in the country, Herz, closed just last April. In the book, Krista frets, “When would I be able to come back [to Herz]? To what was—I suddenly felt it, standing there—one of my favorite bars on this trip?”                                      The answer, post-publication, turns out to be never, which is a theme that runs through the book: We all get only the here-and-now, this one night, these people in this bar in this city, and then it’s gone. Never again.                                      But there’s always the next night, and a different city.                                      Krista describes cities all across the country as having their own idiosyncratic charm and queer communities—gays playing beach volleyball in Virginia, getting overly competitive at cornhole in Colorado, inventing fried pepperonis dipped in ranch in Ohio, and it all added up into one big gay americana hug. To top it all off, Krista meets with the mothers of Free Mom Hugs, who give queer folks hugs at parades and stand-in for absent parents at weddings. Yeah, parts of this book made me tear up.                                       Moby Dyke                                      felt as close to a great night out as it’s possible to get without being surrounded by actual sweaty bodies.

This is an insightful observation of our society and how it has grown into a more inclusive place. I was also quite surprised that queer folks have the need to be around queer people so much. I learned a lot about the lifestyle and the many ""types"" of queerness. I particularly enjoyed the historical parts of how the bars came to be, the neighborhood descriptions: what they were like ""back in the day"" and how much gentrification they experienced.

And funny! And necessary! It's a challenge to write about 20 different lesbian bars, many of which have the same wall colors, music, and self-descriptors, without it becoming redundant, but Krista made each chapter fun and immersive--I genuinely felt like I was at each bar and was disappointed when I looked up and realized I was, in fact, not. I hope to actually visit as many of these as possible one day, plus all the new bars that have since opened!                                      The author's experience as a femme (mistaken for straight) visiting these bars, often with her trans husband, highlighted the question of inclusivity as these bars grappled with self-identifying as ""for lesbians"" or ""for everyone."" A certain quote from a bartender at the Yellow Brick Road in Tulsa, OK was especially poignant; I cannot quote the book until it is published.

With natural humor, wit, and curiosity, Krista Burton has created a sapphic epic through discovering cross-country community. A blend of personal narrative, reflection, and informative interviews with bar-goers and owners makes each page of this beautiful book unique, loving, and utterly personal. It is truly a book that you can come home to.                                      Burton interrogates her experiences and thoughts throughout the book - why are historically lesbian bars tasked with inclusivity while gay bars are not? What are the principles and values that matter most in the daily operation of these spaces? Why are lesbian bars closing; what does this say about the economic status of queer people? Are these spaces welcoming to straight-presenting queer couples (her own experience being herself, a femme, with her trans husband)? Who are these spaces for? Her continuous reflections on her own experiences and privilege in these spaces is refreshing as she observes economic, racial, and gender disparities in bars across all regions of the United States. I highly recommend reading the book in order of bar - there are quite a few thoughts that develop in linear progression, and Burton ensures that every bar is represented authentically and uniquely throughout.                                      Yet, she doesn't shy away from the challenges. On three separate occasions, Burton observes older, straight/cis, white men objectifying the folks that these spaces seek to protect. She then recounts how immediately security becomes involved, how queer spaces are actively protected by the community they serve. At a drag show, consent is announced, made mandatory, and the safety of the performers is established as paramount. These wonderful conversations around inclusivity, safety, and consent are essential when discussing queer spaces today.                                      A standout quote with a bartender reminds us that, no matter what, appreciating lesbian bars for their history as lesbian-owned spaces for lesbians, is paramount to many of these historic bars. I thought it was a wonderful way to approach the conundrum of labels when designating a space for certain kinds of queer people. In a way, it is similar to how queer history should be examined: with respect for those who came before us and their mission, we must go forth and create a home for those who need it most.","320 pages, ebook                             First published June 6, 2023","A former                                 Rookie                                contributor and creator of the popular blog                                 Effing Dykes                                investigates the disappearance of America’s lesbian bars by visiting the last few in existence.

I love the concept of exploring the last 21 lesbian bars in America. After reading the description, I immediately wanted to learn more: why are there so few left when gay bars seem to be thriving, where are these last few, and what is being done to keep them around and create more?                                      I think part what holds this book back for me is that each section was less about the bar and more about the author's experience at each place. As someone who is more of a homebody, I was hoping to learn more about each location - it's history, the owners, etc - and instead it just became kind of repetitive for me. All of her experiences start to blur together. At one point she admits that she stopped researching them before visiting which was disappointing for me. I wish in the editing process later though that historical and contextual background could have been added to show more about each bar and what makes them unique.                                      Overall, this is a fun travel guide if you are looking to go party and drink at lesbian bars. The author's writing is fun and friendly, and often feels like a new friend you met at one of the bars and has so many great stories to share. There were times that the more authoritative tone on queerness rubbed me the wrong way (all lesbians do this, all queers like this), but her overall vulnerability and honesty was endearing. Hearing about her life and experiences really made those personal connections, and I appreciated her theories on why these spaces are needed but disappearing.                                      I think if this is presented less as a sociological look at lesbian bars and more as a travel lesbian bar guide with a hefty dose of personal memoir, I would be less disappointed.","320 pages, ebook                             First published June 6, 2023","A former                                 Rookie                                contributor and creator of the popular blog                                 Effing Dykes                                investigates the disappearance of America’s lesbian bars by visiting the last few in existence.

It's impossible for me to overstate the grip Effing Dykes had on me and my friends as baby gays circa 2011 and I was thrilled to be back with Krista's hilarious, vulnerable voice. I'm definitely that lesbian who waxes poetic about dyke bars long-gone (rest in peace, Sisters of Philadelphia), but also I hate drinking, leaving my house, and spending money going out which makes me part of the problem. I had so much fun living vicariously through this book, which I read in 3-4 sittings. I will never stop thinking about the toilet incident at Cubbyhole.                                      Love a book that assumes queer cultural knowledge from its readers and isn't clinical/corny in its approach to queer issues and history!!                                      This is very much a process-forward book and I appreciated Krista's transparency in how she selected lesbian bars, made specific rules for her case studies (e.g. she visited every bar twice and made sure to talk to at least 2 strangers), and stretched her book advance to cover the cost of travel. This book feels so cohesive and fun, despite weaving together many, many different bars, cities, and experiences, and all the difficult planning and financial finagling that went into it. Gay people who don't like karaoke will feel SEEN and VALIDATED.","320 pages, ebook                             First published June 6, 2023","A former                                 Rookie                                contributor and creator of the popular blog                                 Effing Dykes                                investigates the disappearance of America’s lesbian bars by visiting the last few in existence.

An essential lesbian travel book! In the 1980s there were over 200 lesbian bars, now there are only a few dozen.

I didn’t think a travel book would make me emotional, but this book nearly brought me to tears. But I found myself smiling with watery eyes as Burton detailed the competing in dildo races at Houston’s Pearl Bar and described line dancing in Phoenix’s Boycott bar. Burton writes with a casual beauty that transported me from my quiet suburb to a pulsing room packed with queer people dancing boundless joy. I would often close my eyes and envision the bars, imagining myself walking underneath the fairy lights towards a bar where I know I’ll get an overpoured drink.                                      I have only been to one lesbian bar (Slammer’s in Columbus, it’s great you should go!!). Even though I’ve only been once, it felt like home. This was the same thing I felt while reading this book. There is something purely joyful about entering a space and seeing people who look and love like you do.

So starting with the good things about this book: it's super interesting and if you're a person who likes roadtrips then the easy to read structure of each chapter being a new bar, and therefore a new place, will most likely keep you interested and engaged the whole the time. I also found the voice the book is written in, very clearly the author's internal monologue, bordering on Holden Caulfield style just a complete stream of conscious thought train, very easy to read and it made the chapters fly by.                                      The con however is that, while easy to read, the author's voice isn't necassarily enjoyable. I think it's either a love it or you hate it type thing. The author also spends a lot of time reflecting on queer identity and community and who belongs in what spaces, with somewhat mixed results imo. For example, even though she spends long thought trains dedicated to thinking about how nice it would be if the queer community wasn't so judgemental she then follows it up with.... judgements about the other queers she's running into! Obviously no one is perfect but it feels like there could have been a bit more self-reflection at some point.","320 pages, ebook                             First published June 6, 2023","A former                                 Rookie                                contributor and creator of the popular blog                                 Effing Dykes                                investigates the disappearance of America’s lesbian bars by visiting the last few in existence.

I was interested in reading this book to find out more about contemporary life. I am an older straight woman who has never visited a lesbian bar. It sounded like a lot of fun from this book with its depictions of drag shows, karaoke and ""watch parties"". I was surprised to learn that lesbian bars seem to be frequented by couples or groups of friends, rather than as a place to meet potential partners. What I am trying to say is that this book is very accessible to anyone, even if you are not part of lesbian community. I will note that despite the fact I live in a large city and hear cursing all the time, there is more foul language in ordinary conversations in this book than I hear in my daily life and it took me a bit to get used to.                                      I was delighted to hear in the epilogue that the trend towards the closing of lesbian bars, which was the impetus for this inquiry, seems to be reversing. It is important to have spaces to gather where one feels comfortable, and these bars fit that bill.                                      As always, I listened on audio. Sarah Beth Pfeifer did a wonderful job, sounding enthusiastic and                                      engaged with the material.

Secondly, I'm so jealous I didn't get to write this book.                                      Krista Burton traveled to the last remaining lesbian bars in the United States in order to write about their atmospheres and why they're so important. I went into this book expecting to learn about the history and overall cultural impact of lesbian bars in the U.S., but this is more of Burton's personal experiences (both in life as a lesbian, and her visits to these bars) as well as how important these bars are to individual communities. Even though it wasn't quite what I was expecting, I really enjoyed the personal aspects of Burton's travels and I think it added a lot of heart. I also enjoyed reading about the impact these bars had on their communities. Those spaces are precious, and even though I haven't had the chance to visit a lesbian bar, I could feel how loved they are through the page.                                      I'd definitely recommend to people interested in queer culture, travel literature, and memoirs. This is a joyous read, and I really hope I get the opportunity to visit some of these bars someday.","320 pages, ebook                             First published June 6, 2023","A former                                 Rookie                                contributor and creator of the popular blog                                 Effing Dykes                                investigates the disappearance of America’s lesbian bars by visiting the last few in existence.

I found a lot of the author's interjections to be very distracting and took away from the central question of how to build community. I found it actually proved that even writing a book about the community. She focused so much on herself that may be one of the problems with building community if everyone is just thinking about themselves. I also found it strange that she focused so much on her shyness. I wanted from this book to get a snapshot of these different bars and the way makes them special and unique. I also felt she focused so much on writing about how she set up the trip, which I really don't care about and she should have focused on what the bar meant. I'm curious if she didn't consider talking to neighbors or to people in the community as to the role that a lesbian bar plays in the community. Instead she went to a lesbian bar, very shyly and maybe or maybe didn't talk to some people and then wrote about it. Not enough for my taste.","320 pages, ebook                             First published June 6, 2023","A former                                 Rookie                                contributor and creator of the popular blog                                 Effing Dykes                                investigates the disappearance of America’s lesbian bars by visiting the last few in existence.

This is an insightful observation of our society and how it has grown into a more inclusive place. I was also quite surprised that queer folks have the need to be around queer people so much. I learned a lot about the lifestyle and the many ""types"" of queerness. I particularly enjoyed the historical parts of how the bars came to be, the neighborhood descriptions: what they were like ""back in the day"" and how much gentrification they experienced. But after the visits in San Fran, NY, LA, and San Diego, I had an indigestion of lesbian bar visits and queer talk.

Given that the ARC was labeled “uncorrected proof,” I will not offer any quotations.                                      Vickers not only describes a long and interesting career, spanning decades and several US presidents, but offers insight into his efforts to expand his understanding of the choice points encountered in international politics. His process of education and training is described in great detail. He consistently sought to enhance his knowledge and skills, taking advantage of the resources provided by the federal government and universities close to his employment.                                      Details on his experiences are included to assist the reader in seeing connections among the activities of individuals and agencies across the globe. His contributions to achieving US priorities are understandably at the center of the text. He offers extensive analysis of many global areas of conflict (e.g., Afghanistan) and efforts to contain terrorism (e.g., Usama Bin Laden). I was impressed by his success in providing a narrative on world tensions that seldom lagged, even given an extensive presentation of names and activities to fully understand the events under review.                                      Vickers includes an extensive list of notes, many of which provide additional details pertinent to a segment of the text. Other cited resources include books written by colleagues and various experts on intelligence gathering, special operations, and strategy. Also noted are public (redacted) versions of federal agency reports.                                      Vickers’ memoir, in closing, focuses on his role in various activities, partnerships with other US-based professionals and representatives from other countries. As might be expected, his critique of decisions made by several US presidents is just that, analysis and support based on his values and experiences. He succeeds in offering information on the internal debates that influenced military and political activities.                                      Highly recommended for readers who love memoirs and nonfiction history.","576 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 20, 2023","A vivid narrative of a life in intelligence and special operations, from the Cold War to the war on terror                              In 1984, Michael Vickers took charge of the CIA’s secret campaign against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Inheriting a strategy aimed at imposing costs on Russia, Vickers transformed the campaign into an all-out effort to help the Afghans win their war. More than any other American, he was responsible for the outcome in Afghanistan that led to the end of the Cold War.

In captivating detail, he depicts his years in Special Forces, revealing how those experiences directly influenced his approach to shaping policy, and offers a deeply informed analysis of the greatest challenges facing America today.                              This is a riveting and illuminating insider’s account of the military and intelligence worlds at every level."

Vickers,4.71,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Memoir']",Kindle $14.99,Jer,Rating 3 out of 5,"July 2, 2023","I feel bad giving this book ⭐️⭐️⭐️, given the man’s contributions, but as a compiled work, it was really more of a ⭐️⭐️ situation. Didactic, repetitive, opinionated, and focused on self in a way that was somehow grating, this confusing melee of memories really let me down.                                      The first 5-10% about the author’s early career were really interesting. Even some of the initial CIA covert action stuff was fine, given his unique perspective as the ops officer running something so well-known… but everything after that was confusingly circular, focusing on topics instead of following chronology, providing narrative from a perspective of continuity even when he was in completely different roles.                                      Overall, it felt like either a case of “if I had more time this would have been shorter” or “I want to get all my opinions and perspectives aligned in a self-reinforcing manner to refute any objections,” not the work of a senior national security advisor recounting his career. I don’t think there’s more than one point where he admits anything he said or did may have been in error, but I would say a solid 20% of the book is riddled with accusations levied at how others did not follow his advice and “look where that got us.”                                      While I am grateful for his service, the book makes very clear that Mike Vickers was more of an opinionated manager than an inspired leader, someone who cares about doing “the right thing the right way” (without room for alternative views or personal errancy) regardless of the self-contradictions or absurdities. If you took his one-sided views at face value then the defense budget would be 50% of the US GDP and we would have troops deployed in every country in “small forces tamping down insurgencies” or “countering regional hegemonic encroachment” (because global hegemony is somehow the obvious natural state of things).                                      Maybe this book will get better with age… it’s unlikely I’ll ever find out, as there’s really nothing worth returning for after you’ve a slogged through once. Ironically, that makes Afghanistan a more appealing place to spend some time than between these pages… if Vickers was a true “insurgent at heart” (which seems to be at least partly true) then perhaps some solace will be found in the reader’s immediate need to divest from the overwhelming self-indulgence of this work… an intellectual revolt, if there ever were one.","576 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 20, 2023","A vivid narrative of a life in intelligence and special operations, from the Cold War to the war on terror                              In 1984, Michael Vickers took charge of the CIA’s secret campaign against the Soviets in Afghanistan.

In Rivermouth, Oliva focuses on the physical spaces that make up different phases of immigration and looks at how language and opportunity move through each of them; from the river as the waterway that separates the US and Mexico, to the table as the place over which Oliva prepares asylum seekers for their Credible Fear Interviews, and finally, to the wall as the behemoth imposition that runs along America’s southernmost border.

I just couldn't with this. It's not well crafted. It needs to have a more realistic synopsis, or a heavy round of editing done. With memoirs in which you don't know the author, you can't just start oversharing on page 5 if it's not what the book's about. The bucket list story is over and done by chapter 1, and then each chapter follows a different bucket list item, with no consistency at all. Some are very short, some are very long. Most have useless/uninteresting information in the middle. I can see how as the author you want people to know who your dad was, but you can make that more efficiently from a craftmanship point of view than by derailing the whole story for 3/4 of a chapter to tell us about his divorce. Had this been more subtle and more focused on the bucket list itself, it would've been a hit for me.","304 pages, Paperback                             First published June 13, 2023","Featured in New York Post and People Magazine                              On the cusp of middle age, a newlywed journalist discovers and finishes the bucket list of her late free-spirited father.

2023-07-03,My Father's List: How Living My Dad's Dreams Set Me Free,,Laura Carney,4.33,"['Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Nonfiction']",Kindle $9.99,Boni,Rating 3 out of 5,"July 1, 2023","I had high hopes for this book, and actually ordered a real-life hard copy when I saw it being cleverly touted on a TV show whose parent company also owned the publishing company of this book. It was the author, Laura Carney’s first book, likely her only, as she was in her early 40’s and used the unique hook of fulfilling her Dad’s bucket list found a few years earlier. Though there is some tie to her adventures at fulfilling some of the 60 items, it was mainly a memoir, outlaying the hardships she faced growing up on heavy meds, and possibly burdened with ADHD or bipolar personality. It really was a little heartbreaking seeing how her divorced parents (with a secret) tried to carve a good path for her. Rotten school kids seemed to have scarred her at least as much as her family life.                                      Outside of her mental challenges as a youth, her situation seemed a little pedestrian to me. The stint in the mental health ‘institution’ was sad and a little scary (e.g., electric shock therapy!) I had been hoping for wisdom earned from the Herculean tasks set out for her, but her personality and childhood burdens carried into adulthood made this more about personal growth to overcome those deep-rooted psychological wars she was mired in, even as an adult forced out to the adult world. She may have looked fine on the exterior, but her insides were no doubt still a war zone. From the reviews, I see that this book hit home for many, and was no doubt cathartic for the author, in a daily journal way. She cleared her soul in the process, since she had deep-seated anger issues with her dad’s divorce and death by auto accident when she was 25. The subtitle was so appropriate - How Living My Dad’s Dreams Set Me Free.                                      This book was clearly about that journey, that cleansing for her, and a little part tracking/journaling about her career, and a very minor part peaking at how she made her way through her father’s bucket list items. Good for those readers who 5-star reviewed this, and good for her for becoming the person she is today, and good for her for publishing a book that resounds with so many people. I’m sure she has given folks courage and fortitude they may not have had before.                                      But unfortunately for me, the read was disjointed. Hard to follow. Hard to enjoy. And her seeing signs and symbols in EVERYTHING seemed a little too coincidental or perhaps contrived for my tastes. I’m not doubting her sincerity, but it seemed every event, like walking down the London street and spotting a fox, the “symbol of diplomacy” crossed the border yet again. It felt like the editor was giving her a free pass when it came to organizing thoughts, as they seemed to careen around, making it frustrating to fully appreciate her story. Her intent was clear though. Spirituality rose from every page, with supernatural essence oozing from most all of her thoughts, a great counterbalance against her bad juju from her youth and it’s lack of self confidence… I did enjoy her journeys and travelogue history, short and sweet but nice research tidbits of her travels… though some of her perceived points of interest offered up were mundane and pedestrian, more suited for a diary, like who walked slow, who was late. And lots of family bickering.                                      It was hard to imagine her carrying on this expensive list with unsteady jobs, with her health issues, and her family and husband. Some were very expensive (like traveling to London, Paris, Vienna, etc., attending the Rose Bowl and Final four basketball game, the New Orleans Jazz Festival thrown in, etc.) and she seemed unable to afford it, especially over an arbitrary time to complete the list. Then all of a sudden she’s rich from 8 freelance writing jobs despite being dropped by her literary agent… and can go to the Super Bowl after all ($5,000???). Huh?                                      This whole tale of completion is a little specious, until you see how she interprets each item to allow ‘completion’. Just a few eyebrow-raisers: beating a number one seed in tennis… having more money than you need… dancing with your grandchildren’s weddings, play a guitar (2 notes to the Jaws ‘song’ 😂)… golfing a few rounds in the 70s (when she’d never golfed in her life). I guess part of the book’s entertainment is the surprise at how she interprets each list item’s completion… such a clever (?) girl. 😂 I’m still not sure how she rationalized some of them (as not every task was explained)but why get picky… she was able to fill nearly 300 pages.                                      In the acknowledgements sections, the author writes to her dad with the gratefulness for him teaching her about selfishness, something she was not good at! What a wonderful gift. And then she acknowledged to us the readers, that she always thought this book was just for her. And for her Dad. I didn’t end up loving this self-help book so much, but how can you not LOVE the author, Laura Carney, who overcame such hardship to evolve to have a great peace of mind, I think… I hope. Kudos to you, Laura Carney. You’re AWESOME!","304 pages, Paperback                             First published June 13, 2023","Featured in New York Post and People Magazine                              On the cusp of middle age, a newlywed journalist discovers and finishes the bucket list of her late free-spirited father.

From skydiving, visiting Venice, and swimming across a river, to being a loving parent/partner and fulfilling creative goals such as publishing a book, recording songs, and playing piano or guitar, Laura's dad was a dreamer.

Grover's voice shines, as does her self-awareness -- this book does its best work when it turns the lens on the reader and the author simultaneously, asking the reader to consider their own positionality while Grover herself unravels where her reality ends and where the narrativization of her identities, through her graduate education in gender studies, her metropolitan landing place, and the greater ""queer community,"" begins. I'm sure this is only the first of many hits from Grover to come.","176 pages, Kindle Edition                             First published June 20, 2023","""I've lived a completely ordinary life, so much that I don't know how to write a transgender or queer or Appalachian story, because I don't feel like I've lived one.... Though, in searching for ways to write myself in my stories, maybe I can find power in this ordinariness.""                              Raised in southeast Ohio, Stacy Jane Grover would not describe her upbringing as ""Appalachian."" Appalachia existed farther afield—more rural, more country than the landscape of her hometown.                              Grover returned to the places of her childhood to reconcile her identity and experience with the culture and the people who had raised her. She began to reflect on her memories and discovered that group identities like Appalachian and transgender are linked by more than just the stinging brand of social otherness.                              In                               Tar Hollow Trans                              , Grover explores her transgender experience through common Appalachian cultural traditions. In ""Dead Furrows,"" a death vigil and funeral leads to an investigation of Appalachian funerary rituals and their failure to help Grover cope with the grief of being denied her transness.

He did that for some time but branched into journalism to better support himself.                                      While searching for a new project he latched onto the idea of riding across country on the Pony Express Trail.                                       The significance of the Pony Express is not as apparent as its execution is memorable. The value of what happened during those eighteen months has transgressed the tangible effects carried in the padlocked saddle bags. The Pony Express as a cultural symbol has enjoyed a lot of traction over the years, and among the many artists, authors, journalists, and historians to depict and describe it, few have been able to resist romanticizing it.                                      His idea was to do it with two horses, one to ride and one as a pack horse. He didn't intend to race but to do so at a leisurely pace, so he could really immerse himself in the country, get to know people and protect his horses from injury.                                      This is an eminently readable book. I loved traveling along side Will and finding out all kinds of interesting things about the country, landscape, agriculture.

I've heard of the Pony Express, but did not know about the actual trail, what it actually did, what type of mail or messages that were delivered. The premise sounded a bit like another book I read a few years ago, where the author and his brother endeavored to retrace the path of The Oregon Trail (yes, the actual one that many know from the game). This is not exactly like that but I was curious to see what this would entail.                                      The author retraces the path, meeting various people such as ranchers, farmers, historians, and businessmen along the way. The book also talks about the history of the Pony Express from how it came to be and what it did. Grant also talks about the dangers of the trip, from weather to animals to bandits, etc. It was not necessarily unusual for a rider to meet a tragic end, with Grant relaying how one rider's horse arrived at the station, without its rider, whose fate is unknown.                                      The negative reviews are correct. The concept was really great and this is a part of US history that is mythologized (the Pony Express was actually operating for only about 18 months) but it just felt very dull and unrealized. The historical parts of the book about the actual Pony Express were interesting (ie, the parts about the riders) but it was not something that really clicked with me.                                      If the Pony Express interests you specifically, or issues like message delivery and the system of the Pony Express, etc. interest you, this might be an interesting read. But as someone who had a passing interest I just felt there was more the author could have done with the journey.                                      Borrowed from the library and that was best for me.","336 pages, Hardcover                             First published June 6, 2023","“Spellbinding…an unforgettable journey across the American West.” - Douglas Preston                              For readers of Rinker Buck, Bill Bryson, and Larry McMurtry, The Last Ride of the Pony Express boldly illuminates America's mysterious and complex connection to the iconic Pony Express.

The vivid, flowing, and lyrical prose drew me instantly into the story. In beautiful words, Sally captures the essence of travel and the places she visited.                                      The reflective nature of the story reveals the author’s admirable and understated courage in coming to terms with understandably deep-seated fears. She also explores her troubled relationship with mother, seeking connection through the pages of the journal. As is often the case with travel and encounters with strangers, her journey results in unexpected revelations.                                      Book recommendations for the areas the author visited appear throughout. They constitute a great reading list, regardless. However, they would be FAB if you planned to visit any of the places mentioned in the book! I also loved the snippets of historical facts. I definitely share the author’s fascination with uncovering morsels of knowledge in each location I visit.                                      I couldn’t put this book down. I not only found it very inspiring, but I made notes throughout on places I need to visit.                                      What more can you ask from a travel book?

As she ventures into the heart of the Mediterranean – wandering volatile landscapes, exploring historical sites, pairing books with places and savouring the tastes of Greece – she finds it is possible for a clumsy, out-of-shape woman on a budget to experience a life-changing journey.

2023-07-03,Unpacking for Greece,,Sally Jane Smith,4.77,"['Memoir', 'Travel', 'Nonfiction']",Buy on Amazon,Lisa Wright,Rating 5 out of 5,"June 4, 2023","Sally Jane Smith finds herself in ‘middlesence’, determined to rediscover her travel mojo, ten years after a devastating head-on crash in Sri Lanka left her fearful and broken.                                      Through the story run themes of discovery; about Sally herself, and about her relationship with her mother, whose travel diary Sally takes with her – dipping in and out as she visits some of the same places. The diary is a thread which weaves itself through the book, but there’s another tiny thread too; Sally begins the trip hating olives, and ends it ‘eating them with gusto’. Is this a metaphor for the author’s changing feelings about travelling solo once more?                                      Sally says this memoir is not a Shirley Valentine story. No, it’s something far deeper and far more beautiful. As a debut work, this is incredible. Sally’s prose is wonderfully descriptive yet surprisingly sparse at times. A few well-chosen words paint a vivid picture of her travels that many established writers fail to achieve, whilst tiny vignettes of people and places make this into something far more than a simple travel story. It’s immersive, informative but never dull, and totally enthralling. I first read this as a beta reader, but bought and re-read the finished book because I wanted to return to Sally’s Greece. I was as enthralled the second time round. Now that is good travel writing.","245 pages, Paperback                             First published June 1, 2023","When Sally sets out for Europe with her mother’s 1978 travel diary in her pocket, she is searching for the wanderlust she lost in a devastating overseas road accident.

Even one of my favorites (Lisa Jewell) stumbled a bit with the very unnecessary                                       The Family Remains                                      (good news is, she has another release coming up this Summer and that one is a banger). When I saw Samantha Irby was getting ready to release her own pandemic offering, I was so there for it. I mean she’s hilarious to begin with so her take on quarantine life was sure to be a winner. Right?                                      Unfortunately, wrong. I mean there were times when I was like oh yes bish, you are me . . . .                                        “Quietly hostile is how I would describe my public personality. I am mild-mannered and super polite, but just beneath the surface of my skin, my blood is electrified and I am one inconsiderate driver away from a full Falling Down-style emotional collapse.”                                       And there were the standard LOLz from stories of a weak bladder (and anal sphincter), a near-death experience via allergic reaction and how delicious a “dip dinner” can be. Buuuuuuuuuut then there was a deep dive into which Dave Matthews songs are her faves and over 20% of the word count spent analyzing porn and breaking down Sex and the City eps . . . .                                      As someone who still calls it Sex IN the City – I was obviously not the target demographic for any of that. I was also not aware the Irby wrote “The Pool Episode” of                                       Shrill                                      (but I have actually watched it and thought it was the only 100% great one in the first season so kudos to you, Irby). Nor did I know (or really care) that she was a part of the                                       Sex and the City                                      reboot.

I definitely feel like I benefited from listening to the audiobook, and if she narrated her other books too, that's the format I'll choose for those as well.                                        I'm not sure if I would have finished this book if it weren't for Irby's engaging narration. While there were several moments that made me smile or even chuckle a little, they were all at the very beginning of the book, and then most of the following essays kind of lost my interest. I'll most likely check out another of her books to see if it was just an issue with this one, but I was a little let down. I'm hoping it's just an issue with                                           Quietly Hostile                                          because Irby strikes me as the kind of author I want to love, so hopefully the next one will be a better fit for me!

I aimed to read the first few pages only, just to get a flavour of it, but, like any great book, before I knew it, I had been carried away on a rather swift and rather gusty wind of complete relatability, unapologetic stances and laugh-out-loud funny moments all tied neatly into a pretty bow with each page exuding realism, emotion and often biting, acerbic wit.                                      Drawing from as vast personal subjects as her favourite music, sexual trysts, ongoing health troubles, her complicated family dynamic and the inconvenience and stress of the coronavirus outbreak at the time, each essay is a self-contained gem and a snippet of Irby's life with each having a relatability and pure genuineness that is rarely found within the genre and that resonated with me through to the last page. The liberally interspersed sardonic, self-deprecating humour throughout is a joy to behold and had me racing through the pages which is quite unusual for an essay collection.                                      However, I wasn't interested in the essay about Sex & the City and going through what she would change about each episode because I don't like or care about the show and going through quite a few of Dave Matthews Band tracks similarly but stating why she likes them in a separate essay also lost my attention slightly after being engrossed up until those points, but, of course, this is all subjective. For me, there was a slight lull in those sections, but in an anthology of topical writings, such as this you, will naturally find some more compulsively readable than others.                                      That said, Irby is inimitable when she addresses topics of interest as she manages to strike the perfect balance between casual and amusing remarks, openness and honesty, emotion and apathy, light-heartedness and seriousness about her situations, feelings and thoughts. The most hilarious part of the collection in which I could barely contain my exuberant laughter was the essay entitled 'shit happens'. It had me cringing and snorting in equal measure, and in 'o brother, where art thou?' a few tears slipped down my cheek while she discussed the death of her mother which was poignant and emotional.                                      I can't wait to read more from such a strong, fearless and unique voice; Irby fills these pages with the thoughts many of us are thinking but are often too embarrassed or shy to espouse, and she has the balls to place them in a book! Highly recommended.","304 pages, Paperback                             First published May 16, 2023","Samantha Irby invites us to share in the gory particulars of her real life, all that festers behind the glitter and glam.

Or they order whatever's on the bar menu that has mezcal in it and therefore tastes like burning newspaper? When did we start doing that?                                      ""                                      HAHAHAHA.                                      This woman is FUNNY, even if I can admit that this latest book is not my favorite of hers. There were a few too many essays here that didn't hold my attention (see: ""Two Old Nuns Having Amzing [Sic] Lesbian Sex"" ... and if you're like,                                       whoa                                      to that title, you've clearly never been introduced to this author's work!)                                      My favorite might have been ""I Like It!""—a brilliant take down (and come back) for every person that ""puts you on the defensive, that sends you down an internal spiral thinking,                                       Why do I like the dumb shit I like?                                      "" I've jokingly used that line a few dozen times already.                                      I also fell down a rabbit hole listening to Dave Matthew Band songs after reading Samantha's essay on her love of the band. AND knowing she loves Aidan as much as I do (""he was cuter than Big, nicer than Big, more thoughtful than Big..."") I might have watched a ""Best of Aidan"" SATC montage on YouTube after I read her (did it                                       really                                      have to be that long?) essay about her experiences as a writer on ""And Just Like That.""                                      Overall, it's a great day when a new Irby collection hits the shelves. Even when its contents are list-heavy and a bit niche-y, there's still much to learn                                       ""from an essay writer who creates literacy currency out of commiseration and coping.""","304 pages, Paperback                             First published May 16, 2023","Samantha Irby invites us to share in the gory particulars of her real life, all that festers behind the glitter and glam.

This time around Irby shares her love for Dave Matthews and Sex and the City in extreme detail that kind of made me scratch my head. I mean, we’re talking about breaking down lyrics from a ton of DMB songs, breaking down an obscene amount of scenes from the OG SaTC series… obviously there’s some hilarious observations here but I had to skim after I was 10+ pages into these obsessions.                                      She’s still discussing IBS, healthcare, ageing, and plenty of relevant topics in awkward detail that leaves me cackling.

Her essays can be raw, but with very good reason. She seems to always find herself in the most awkward, uncomfortable situations, enough to well, write a book! I adore her! She is never afraid to tell us about the good, the bad, and the smelly!                                      Her humor comes by way of a strange life, with a mother who was ill and a father who was gone. Later in life as she relays in this book that she discovers a stepbrother and others she never knew existed. The toll from her childhood not only formed who she is today, but estranged her from her sister, but that’s okay.                                      Embarrassment is Irby’s middle name. And that’s what makes this book so good. Irby’s internal dialogue with herself is hysterical, enlightening but also empathizing. Her book dedication says it all…open the book, just for that!                                      Her essays touch on very relatable topics as how she and her wife had to adjust to living with each other, such as the day Irby opened the refrigerator and discovered all these new and odd healthy food items, but she also had to get use to a couple of stepchildren and how to deal with them. Her advice is priceless!                                      One of her essays honestly is a true test of embarrassment when she seems to have taken, eaten, or smelled something which sent her to the hospital with anaphylactic shock and all that came before her visit, and during the visit, only to find out that typical Irby, she has no idea what caused the problem.                                      She and her wife, like many during the pandemic, decided to adopt a dog, but each time they found one it was always taken. And then her wife found one, which Irby was not too keen on and life as they knew it would never be the same!                                      For anyone interested in writing for television, she gives a detailed description of how to write a pilot and all that entails…years and when the final production is finished only be told we’ll pass.                                      But for me, the BEST essay is the one in which she breaks down old Sex and the City episodes. Irby, now a writer for And Just Like That, gives her take on what she believes should have happened in the episodes and why. ( I read this essay twice because it was hysterical)!                                      The title Quietly Hostile fits Irby’s personality perfectly. She doesn’t have a lot to say outwardly, but her inside dialogue fits all of us to a tee!

Erm, maybe not actually, because I think they're mostly Pepto Bismol. And she probably doesn't *actually* have grocery lists, she's too busy in Anthropologie buying candles she doesn't really need, or some treats for a house party she's not actually going to go to. I think it took me until I was only 3% in to text a friend saying ""have you read anything of hers? I just spat out my Diet Coke on the train.""                                      Either way, I'd quite like to be her friend - but I'm sure everyone says that, right? Mostly, I'd like to just have access to her lengthy descriptions of adult films.

I’m not sure if it’s partly my own fault because I listened to the audiobooks of all of Irby’s other books and chose a print copy for this, which is definitely a different experience, but for whatever reason this one didn’t resonate with me at all.                                      There were a few stand out essays, but a lot of them felt like filler fluff. I think a good part of what I liked about her other work is how unflinchingly honest she is. And while she still was to an extent in this collection, it’s about unimportant and frankly boring topics.

Many people took MLK’s                                      nonviolent approach as passivity….. but….. forget that - Martin Luther King Jr. was actually very aggressive with nonviolent protests.                                      “MLK (called Little Mike at home) was deliberately misunderstood in his lifetime… And he remains so today”.                                      This is the first biography to make use of thousands of recently released FBI documents, (King was under stressful, surveillance), thousands of other researched papers, letters, business records, White House phone recordings, oral histories, un-aired television footage. Many family and friends that contributed to this book.                                      Those closest people to King saw his flaws all along. His power grew from his ability to grapple with contradictions.                                      But when pressure against King built up, he didn’t back down—-despite the obvious risks. Yet — MLK did have health problems, and one wonders if the stress that he lived under was partly the cause.                                      King reminded his followers of the moral beauty of their fight.                                      It was not only for fairness, it was for the future.                                      It was for redemption. It was for America to be a better loving country for all people.                                      It was for God.                                      Every single time that King could’ve stepped down… (and nobody would have blamed him), he kept going.                                      It was his faith in God that kept him going.                                      I got a lot of value and joy from the 20 hours I spent with this book.                                      Phenomenal Biography…..                                      …..covering a full life: family                                      upbringing (his parents, controlling Father, and two siblings), his education, dating a white woman in college, his marriage to Coretta Scott, and their four children, church dedication and leadership, the fight over the bus seat which was much bigger that the immediate injustice, jail, King’s sensitivities, depression, loneliness, beliefs that didn’t waver, his relationship with John F Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson, the March on Washington Street…..etc. etc. This book is massively comprehensive….

King practiced educating White people of the Negro revolution.                                      He was arrested 29 times fighting for justice….and ‘hated’ the isolation.                                      The Baptist Minister and social rights activist was our greatest leader in the civil rights movement in the 1950’s and 60’s.                                      His contribution to civil rights, freedom, an equality for African-Americans was beyond ‘business-as-usual’.                                      He also delivered some of the 20th century’s most exemplary celebrated speeches.                                      King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 —                                      Jonathan Eig should win the Pulitzer Prize for this book in 2023.                                      Given that there had not been a biography on Martin Luther King for almost 40 years… This book is an outstanding accomplishment— relevant to the years we’re living right now.                                      “Love is the only force that can capture hate”.","688 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","The first full biography in decades, King mixes revelatory and exhaustive new research with brisk and accessible storytelling to forge the definitive life for our times.

2023-07-03,King: A Life,,Jonathan Eig,4.72,"['Biography', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Race', 'American History', 'Biography Memoir']",Kindle $16.99,Brina,Rating 5 out of 5,"June 26, 2023","In a nutshell wow. Let me get to wow. A few years ago I read Jonathan Eig’s Opening Day as my annual Jackie Robinson read. I read about Jackie Robinson every year and know his story well, but this book read like a story, a compelling story at that. I crossed checked with other nonfiction readers who I respect and they all noted that the books of Eig’s that they have read have all been top of the line. Even though at that point I had only read the one book, I could tell. As a primarily nonfiction reader I am always on the lookout as to what my preferred authors are writing or pursuing next. For the last few years, Eig’s news centered around his 2018 exploration of Muhammad Ali, which earned him National Book Award consideration. For his next book, however, Eig desired to tackle a topic greater than Ali. That subject, no small task, was Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. The history buffs among us would be waiting impatiently for that book, sure to be Eig’s signature work, to be published.                                      As a person who grew up reading biographies, I want the book to tell the person’s life story from a myriad of angles. Dr Martin Luther King, Jr has been a part of America’s ethos for over sixty years. Anyone fifteen years or more years older than me would have recollections about the man, either positive or negative, great or small. This biography, the first full length volume about King in thirty five years, was not written for people old enough to remember a living and breathing man. It was written for those born in the seventies and later, my generation and those that come after it, so we would know who this man was from beyond the I Have a Dream speech. Most school age children know the speech rather than the man. This birthday has become a federal holiday, a lead up to African American heritage month. Schools might teach the speech and explain to children to follow their dreams. Or they might have a brief lesson on Dr King. Libraries used to have programs about King on his birthday but now those are closed as well, so school children do not have as much of a chance to learn about who he was or what his movement was about. His birthday becoming yet another three day weekend on the academic calendar. Jonathan Eig set about to rectify this. Generations would learn who Dr King was beyond the I Have a Dream Speech. Since knowing about this book, I had been salivating at my chance to read it, and it lived up to its hype.                                      It is not necessary to regurgitate King’s life. That is the purpose of a biography, and Eig is among the elite when it comes to that. After a chance meeting with one of King’s childhood friends, he was encouraged to interview those who remembered him well, friends and family and acquaintances, before it was too late. He also is the first biographer to utilize works on the internet, his father’s unpublished memoir, and King’s extensive FBI files. From these primary source documents, Eig was able to piece together the life of Dr King from a uniquely new perspective. The background about segregation and Jim Crow and the key events in the civil rights movement all receive their due, but this book is about the whole person behind the movement and how he got to that point. Not all aspects of King’s life were positive or pretty. Even though I have read extensively on Jackie Robinson and the civil rights movement including one of Coretta Scott King’s memoirs, at times this book was still hard to take in, and I had to read it in small doses rather than as one long story, despite Eig’s extraordinary writing. His purpose has been to introduce the whole person and if that meant including the not so savory parts of both King’s life and the civil rights movement, then that’s what it would take to piece together this life for those too young to remember.                                      As a teacher I want to teach about Dr King to my students. Granted I am a substitute and I never know what class I am going to end up with on the days closest to King’s birthday. Somehow the discussion ends up back with I Have a Dream. Little did I know prior to reading that while this speech is considered a cornerstone moment in American history, it is hardly who King was. Although his father was a prominent minister in Atlanta, the schools King attended were segregated, and despite having dedicated teachers, not as advanced as the white schools. King skipped two grades during school and entered Morehouse College at age fifteen. This made him younger and put him at an academic disadvantage to his classmates, leading King to the lifelong tendency to plagiarize. From Morehouse, King attended Crozer Theological Seminary, his first time in the north, and finally to Boston University where he would eventually receive his doctorate in religion. It was in Boston that he wrote a letter of encouragement to Jackie Robinson, noting how his integrating a major sport would open up new opportunities to the race. It was also in Boston that King met his future wife Coretta and realized that he was called to preach in the south. Somehow before the civil rights movement took off, King had a calling that he would be the one to lead it. Still in his twenties, this was a tremendous burden to be placed on anyone, and, yet, King and Coretta answered this call to lead.                                      I am not sure where I would start teaching about King after reading this. Many blacks in the south were thrilled with the gains of the early parts of the civil rights movement. Yet a younger generation lead in part by Malcolm X and then Stokeley Carmichael were not satisfied with King’s adherence to passive resistance and non-violence. They called for black power and a more militant means to achieving societal gains. The more extremist sectors of the civil rights movement called King’s speech a sellout to whites and the federal government. On the other hand, the FBI, an old boys network resistant to change, believed King to be too extremist and wiretapped his phones for years. With access to most of these FBI tapes, we now know that King might not have been a perfect husband or person. He kept mistresses, gambled, drank, and shot pool. He slept four hours a night and was rarely home as he canvassed the country giving speeches and fundraising. When at home, he practiced his sermons and speeches so they would have the desired affect upon delivery, in King’s signature deep booming voice, that at times sounded like singing and prayer. This placed a heavy burden on Coretta as the mother of his four children even though she desired to travel and give speeches of her own. Was King the perfect person and minister that society made him out to be? Probably not but, not to condone his behavior, he would not have been the first prominent person in society to keep a mistress. Was he as left wing as the FBI made him out to be? Again, probably not; initially he just wanted to be treated like a full person under the constitution, an inalienable right that had been granted to white Americans two hundred years prior. Using passive resistance, sermons, peaceful marches, sit-ins, and boycotts does not paint the picture of an extremist person. Rather the release of these FBI tapes paints the bureau as ruthless, extremist, not to be trusted, all in the name of denouncing the person in the movement who was probably the least extreme. By utilizing the FBI tapes, Eig does give readers a more complex person, while stating his unfavorable opinion of the FBI.                                      Jonathan Eig gives his due to Coretta Scott King’s involvement in the movement as well as many key figures including King’s closest friends Ralph Abernathy and Andrew Young. They both play a prominent role in the duration of the book. After reading this biography that was well worth its wait I have come away learning a more complete picture of a man who even I knew most by his speech, birthday, and date of assassination. With the recent death and all but retirement of some of the nation’s prominent historians, the torch has been passed to a younger generation of history writers who write history like the story that it is in a way that makes it accessible to younger generations. Jonathan Eig should have his name at the forefront of discussion when it comes to who is America’s top historian today. His work on King should be considered his opus, one I am privileged to have read, and one that vaults him to the top when discussing a who’s who of America’s history writers                                      5 stars                                      Book of the year","688 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","The first full biography in decades, King mixes revelatory and exhaustive new research with brisk and accessible storytelling to forge the definitive life for our times.

His treatment of Muhammad Ali                                      was comprehensive and memorable. With King and Ali, Eig has recently gravitated toward larger-than-life subjects, so the fruits of his labor have tended to resemble the doorstop, but the readability and flow of this prose will have the reader finishing these works sooner than he is ready to let go of the subject.                                      In King's case, Eig's book is so long because of the staggering amount of research the author performed. About a quarter of the book's length consists of notes and acknowledgments. The latter essay was impressively extensive and movingly written. More than 200 people were interviewed, each of whom is listed, and the author reviewed ""tens of thousands of pages of newly released and newly discovered archival documents,"" including new documents recently released by the FBI.                                      Those FBI documents are pictures of a simpler time. J. Edgar Hoover wanted nothing more than to prove that King was a communist or, barring that, under the influence of communists. It seems that that effort was not successful. But it is quaint, isn't it, to think of an FBI director taking for granted that exposing a civil-rights leader's communist sympathies would                                       matter                                      . (So, too, is it quaint to reflect on the idea of television and newspaper reporters knowing of King's infidelity and refusing to report on it because such subjects were just not discussed in media then.) Today, the focus of such comprehensive surveillance would probably shrug and flip off the camera: ""So what if I                                       am                                      a communist?"" In King's time, which overlapped a little with Joseph McCarthy's, publicly aligning oneself with communists (especially Communists) was career suicide. (Ellen Schrecker's                                        Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America                                       is an excellent backgrounder.) King seemed to tread lightly in this area, but only to the extent that complacency would have undermined his work. In any event, no true communist would have chosen King for his standard bearer. King, after all, demanded only equality of opportunity. The Communist Party would never have accepted a leader who advocated anything short of equality of outcome.                                      In our time, communism and marital affairs may not be celebrated, but nor do they exactly raise eyebrows. However, a real shadow hangs over King. According to an FBI report, a woman was anally raped in King's Washington, D.C. hotel room by a pastor while ""King looked on, laughed, and offered advice."" The quoted language was handwritten over an otherwise typewritten report. The report, which was released last year, summarizes a recording that will be released in 2027.                                      Eig does not hide his skepticism and suggests that the recording will not substantiate the report. Considering King's life and body of work, it is hard not to share Eig's opinion. But if anything has the power to undo the reputation of the first Black person to be memorialized in the nation's capital, it is this. Eig expertly treated the tension that arose between King and the Black Power movement in the 1960s. With colorblindness having been cast aside as either passé or even racist by the Black Power movement's successors, a case can be made that King's philosophy of optimism and universal brotherhood is losing its battle with an obsessively racialized culture of victimhood. The modern-day opponents of King's dream would leap at the opportunity to write out of history the celebration of the content of our character as the boring ramblings of an abettor to rape. Let us hope that they will not have that chance.","688 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","The first full biography in decades, King mixes revelatory and exhaustive new research with brisk and accessible storytelling to forge the definitive life for our times.

It wasn’t that the book was boring. Far from it. In fact, Jonathan Eig’s new biography is much more interesting and exciting than most in the genre. It took me so long because I had to put it down after every chapter or two to absorb what I had read and think about things. I had a rudimentary knowledge of who Martin Luther King was from learning about it in school. I knew that King was about peaceful protest, equality and freedom…and I knew that he was assassinated. Beyond that, I didn’t really know much and to be honest, I probably only knew that much because I grew up in Memphis. Schools don’t spend a lot of time on civil rights in general (mainly during February for obvious reasons), but what little is taught revolves around King. The reason for this is that many people feel that the Civil Rights Movement doesn’t matter much anymore because racism is no longer a problem. This is far from the truth, especially in the southern United States.                                      Jonathan Eig has authored a biography of a great man who was flawed, uncertain and afraid. King was the leader of a movement that brought about change in a country that fought (and still fights) change with every fiber of it’s being. He worked with other great men and women to secure rights for black Americans that many never thought possible. He didn’t always do the right thing and made missteps along the way. Eig doesn’t gloss over King’s mistakes and the book is all the better for it because it humanizes a man who ultimately became a mythic figure who is perceived by many to be “perfect”, which is far from the truth. Eig presents King as a human who is as flawed as the rest of us but was able to do great things in spite of that, which is what King would have wanted in my opinion. Many people will look to things like King’s adultery and try to diminish his accomplishments (just like the FBI did). This is a flawed argument because King never claimed to be perfect and his personal failures have little or nothing to do with his accomplishments for society as a whole. He was not a messiah and never claimed to be. He simply worked to inspire people and in that he succeeded completely and without question.                                      This is not the first biography of MLK and it certainly won’t be the last, but it will likely be known as the best. King: A Life is exhaustively researched and includes interviews with people who were there, recently declassified FBI files and previously available information. To get the most from the book, I would recommend taking the time to digest what you read. While it is extremely well-written and flows in such a way that you want to continue reading, I would encourage you to put it down every so often to reflect on just what happened during the 50’s and 60’s in the United States. Think about the injustices that occurred and are still occurring today. Feel for the people who have suffered and feel pride in the people who stood up for what was right in the face of impossible odds. A much as this may be simply an interesting biography, it is more than that. This is a testament to the man who gave his entire life over to making the world a better place as well as the people who helped him. This is a book that should make you uncomfortable, sad, angry and afraid. This is a book that should remind you of the difference between right and wrong. This is also a book that should give you hope and inspiration.

It was full of information and newly released tape’s that were classified but now declassified. It told the whole story of Martin Luther King Jr. I read it for Black History Month, but just now finishing it. I wasn’t too late with finishing it and reviewing, but a little. Anyway, it was a captivating experience. I was glued to it and wanted to keep reading it all the time. It is controversial, because some might say that certain things that are written about aren’t true of him, but unfortunately, I believe they are. But I believe he was a great leader for the civil rights movement and believe he was born there in that time to do exactly what he did especially at the start of it all. He was so powerful a leader and baptist minister that I had to go listen to some of his speeches and sermons because I wanted to see if what the writer was writing about him was true. And it was. He was very bold in his speeches and sermons. He was not tall at all but had a booming voice and it became even bolder and louder as he spoke on. I believe if he could have continued in the movement as he wanted with the nonviolent approach and message, civil rights would have continued to get better not just for the African American but for us all. Because he approached it as everyone doing it as God would have us to do. Because that is what our nation was founded on, the Gospel of Jesus Christ. But I am troubled about some things I learned that I didn’t believe, like I spoke of above, but I have to say He and God will discuss that. Possibly maybe already have. This book tells the whole story and leaves nothing out. It was a riveting read! I’m glad I read it!

Jonathan Eig’s unputdownable new biography of Martin Luther King Jr is the first full-length work to appear in decades about one of America’s most revered figures, and it is a commendable addition to the vast literature on MLK.                                      As I consumed Eig’s rapidly paced narrative, I appreciated how he avoided the easy temptation to glorify King as Christlike. Instead, he focuses on King’s lifelong commitment to the Christian ethics of love and compassion and of finding purpose and redemption through acts of undeserved suffering for the cause of helping others, which for King constituted the divine test for humans of fulfilling God’s expectations of us.                                      King’s mission to secure justice and equality for all Americans is inspiring, of course, but what can be disturbing is remembering how King’s efforts met perilous resistance from hatemakers, such as the Klan, but also from disgraceful elected officials at every level of government. Although he had a cooperative relationship with President Johnson that influenced the passage of both the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, King’s enemies included governors, mayors, police chiefs, and members of Congress who wanted him gone.                                      When studying MLK’s life and work, trying to put in perspective the degree of cruelty and ruthlessness he faced can feel overwhelming and even numbing. I found it both shameful and sickening to recollect how segregationists were proud to defend themselves as justified in utilizing violence and murder without any fear of intervention from the law so that they could entrench racism and white supremacy in their states, counties, cities, and courts to perpetuate terror and oppression against Black people.                                      As King expanded his mission for attaining civil rights to include confronting the evils of poverty and war, he became more revolutionary in his final years with messaging that echoed Malcolm X who was assassinated three years before King suffered the same fate. In particular, King’s condemnation of the Vietnam War fractured his relationship with LBJ and drew the ire of close friends and, of course, from his sworn enemies. But what enrages me most is a reminder of how hatemakers had no inhibition about using violence against King even as he never wavered in discipline from nonviolent activism.                                      It is also troubling to learn from Eig’s research of newly available FBI reports how J. Edgar Hoover did everything in his power to coordinate schemes to ruin King. Hoover wanted to expose King’s extramarital affairs, and when those attempts didn’t gain traction, he spread falsehoods that branded King as a communist sympathizer intent on destroying American democracy.                                      I found myself at times in disbelief with contemplating how remarkable it was that King somehow survived for 13 years as leader of the Civil Rights Movement amid the relentless homicidal danger he faced on a daily basis. Every time he led an act of civil disobedience to confront the terror and injustice of racism and white supremacy, he encountered mobs of violent hatemakers wanting to harm him.                                      I felt a combination of admiration and sadness for King’s fearlessness and courage to face death threats and still continue to do what was right in exposing the evils of racism, poverty, and militarism. My sorrow had me fighting back tears as Eig documents King’s premonitions of how he knew he was going to die, and yet he remained steadfast to the cause of Christian love and nonviolence towards his enemies as the path to achieving a future humanity where everyone was judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.                                      Throughout this engaging biography, my most lasting impression became Eig’s ability to compel me to reflect upon what has really changed since King’s sacrifices. Only defeatists would argue we’ve made no progress. However, the erosion of American conscience is frightening and alarming when we are forced to witness the resurgence of hate groups demanding their agenda be validated while lunatic politicians celebrate the passage of cruel, ruthless legislation that devastates peoples’ lives, particularly people of color and anyone among the poverty-stricken who King gave his life fighting for.                                      No different than the maniacal segregationists in MLK’s era, those in recent years who have made the proliferation of hate fashionable declare grievance and victimhood for themselves when any effort is made to extend opportunity to others who are different, vulnerable, underprivileged, disadvantaged, or exploited. As King experienced during his life, I still see too much emboldened hatred and shameless misinformation from indecent and uncivil individuals raging against how improvement of America for everyone somehow makes the rich now poor, or how a better America for everyone somehow makes those with power and privilege less equal.                                      Eig’s biography captures both the joy and sorrow of what remembering King requires of us, and in his epilogue he leaves us to consider this challenge: “Our simplified celebration of King comes at a cost. It saps the strength of his philosophical and intellectual contributions. It undercuts his power to inspire change. Even after Americans elected a Black man as president and after that president, Barack Obama, placed a bust of King in the Oval Office, the nation remains racked with racism, ethno-nationalism, cultural division, residential and educational segregation, economic inequality, violence, and a fading sense of hope that government, or anyone, will ever fix those problems.”                                      What might be most vital to take away from Eig’s new study of MLK’s life is the unsettling reminder that whenever we honor King’s achievements, we also must recognize the need to finish his unfinished work, which cost him his life. King was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, and Eig enables us to see that were King alive today he’d be on the front lines fighting to dismantle forces of hate, corruption, hypocrisy, misinformation, and injustice that are still turning us backwards, especially the rampant conniving of those in elected office doing everything in their power to undermine, reverse, and destroy MLK’s work.","688 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","The first full biography in decades, King mixes revelatory and exhaustive new research with brisk and accessible storytelling to forge the definitive life for our times.

Yes he was flawed, but he was also deeply self-aware and truly cared about what he was marching for.

Eig synthesizes the well-known story of King's life with new material, most importantly from unpublished memoirs by King's wife and father, and information from FBI files. If you've been following the story, there's not much new--the FBI material including the specifics about King's sexual life--are presented in Beverly Gage's biography of J. Edgar Hoover, for example. The most problematic aspect of the book, though, is the thin sense of the nuances of African American history and a failure to make use of some of the best recent scholarship in the field. His treatment of Rosa Parks, for example, borders on the old ""tired Black woman"" stereotype of the committed activist established by Danielle McGuire's At the Dark End of the Street as well as various Parks biographies.                                      Just can't recommend it on balance. Taylor Branch's three volume history of America in the King Years remains the standard, while David Garrow's slightly outdated book remains the best one-volume.","688 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","The first full biography in decades, King mixes revelatory and exhaustive new research with brisk and accessible storytelling to forge the definitive life for our times.

He stood up against all hate and unnecessary violence. He marched in several cities where his life was always in danger and stood up against LBJ in regards to Vietnam when this was an unpopular political stance.

This biography, which I listened to on audio (great narration), is definitive proof of that. King's legacy has been sanitized and watered down so that the general public can express admiration for him without actually understanding what his true goals were: the eradication of racism, war, and poverty. People who accept war and would never approve of a universal basic income or reparations probably need to rethink whether they are on the same page as MLK. This book is comprehensive, thorough, and clearly well researched, but it is also well written and compelling. I would love for everyone to read it and spend some time reckoning with the truth of who he was (even the ugly realities of his marital infidelity) and attempting to understand what he truly wanted to accomplish, not just for this country but for the world.

It's become common practice to either totally ignore the serious behavioral flaws of our ""heroes"" or to completely negate substantial contributions they have bestowed to us. Over the years this has been true for the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King who was honored by many but despised by others.                                      In spite of winning the Nobel Prize at 35, leading the Civil Rights Movement, and being honored posthumously with a national holiday bearing his name, he was an imperfect human being who struggled with depression, fear of failure, and sexual unfaithfulness throughout his short life. Much has been written and spoken about him in celebration and also in condemnation. This biography,                                       King: The Life of Martin Luther King                                      so meticulously researched and skillfully written by Jonathan Eig, portrays a great man, a tortured soul, with his faults and gifts clearly on display.                                      I watched King's career as it unfolded in real time, admired his strength, applauded his courage, relished his accomplishments, and was deeply disappointed and saddened by glimpses of his darker side. With this book, I have been able to resolve my confusion and accept the man as he lived with his greatness                                       and                                      his imperfections. It also makes it possible to appreciate others who have served with distinction but have feet of clay. The world needs these people, and while they must be accountable for the inevitable, often unintended harm their human frailties bring, I will strive to also credit the great benefits we inherit from their work.

Jonathan Eig, who has previously written about Muhammad Ali and Jackie Robinson, has written an almost 700 page Biography on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Most of my knowledge of Martin Luther King’s life comes from the basic historical outtakes taught by the Indiana public school system. This is an expansive and compulsively readable book, that begins with King’s grandfather, follows his civil rights leadership, continues through the FBI’s obsessive and perverse surveillance and ends with his assassination. Eig doesn’t turn away from King’s faults but I never felt that it was salacious. I now have a really good understanding of King’s motivations and appreciation of the fact that he never veered from his moral obligation to nonviolence even as those around him began to disagree. The problems that King grappled with, segregation, racism, poverty, and violence are still issues today and King’s words are just as relevant today as they were over fifty years ago.

I grew up during the 1960s, and experienced as any American did during that turbulent decade the assassinations, the Vietnam war, and racial tension over civil rights. I experienced it directly going to school in West Virginia when our schools were integrated.                                      Martin Luther King Jr. was an integral part of everything that happened during the 1960s, and his assassination in 1968 made him a martyr and an icon for the ages. What I knew of King was mostly from the evening network news, where he was a regular fixture, and maybe a little from the newspaper. There were many things about King the public didn't see or know about, but Jonathan Eig brings a whole new perspective on MLK in this biography, which is extremely well written and researched. I would encourage everyone to read it.                                      The author truly did an amazing job to tell the story of MLK from birth to his status in today's fragmented society. We read about King the man, who had many faults, temptations and doubts about his work and calling. It was the 1963 March on Washington and the ""I Have a Dream"" speech that gave King his national notoriety (in my opinion). It also caused the FBI and its paranoid director, J. Edgar Hoover, to look for ways to hurt King and his efforts to further civil rights. Hoover was clearly racially biased towards King, and did all he could to label him a Communist and a person out to undermine American civil order.                                      Reading the hardships that King and his family went through during those turbulent years of his life gave me a new sense of MLK. Likewise, the author's discussion of King's dark side--his liaisons with many different women, his smoking and drinking, his profanity and anger--all just to me demonstrate King was a man who also dealt with sin. The research and fact-checking that went in to this biography was first rate.                                      The book also paints a sad but powerful picture of Coretta Scott King, who stood beside her husband for his short life and contributed as much as King did but in different ways. She is almost given saint-like status in the book but deservedly so. Mrs. King worked the rest of her life to continue MLKs dream and legacy.                                      You can't read this biography and not think about what is still happening in the United States today regarding racism and racial tensions between Black and White. I think Dr. King would be disappointed where we are at as a society. Yes, many things are better for the contemporary Black man and woman than what their parents and grandparents didn't have in their lifetime--the right to vote, anti-discrimination laws, and so forth. But look at all the violence between police and Black victims, with the latest and most troubling event occurring in Memphis of all places (where King was assassinated) with the murder of Tyree Nichols at the hands of five Black police officers.                                      We are a broken nation in terms of race relations. Maybe we always have been and always will be. King did all he could in the 39 years he was alive to make the world a better place, with his nonviolent approach in following the example of Jesus Christ. Racism remains a terrible problem and all of us need to do a better job of standing up to racism wherever we might encounter such action.                                      Read this book. It is very powerful.","688 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","The first full biography in decades, King mixes revelatory and exhaustive new research with brisk and accessible storytelling to forge the definitive life for our times.

He is a hero. It took huge courage to take on the leadership of the campaign against segregation in the 1950s South. Blacks were still being lynched. White violence permeated the South.                                      It took amazing intelligence, faith and strength to convince the black victims that they should conduct a non-violent campaign. No one else could have made that happen.                                      It took an overwhelming passion for justice and a relentless drive to force America to try to be worthy of its promises and to continue the fight until the day he died.                                      And he was the most brilliant American orator of the twentieth century.                                      What King accomplished in his life is awe inspiring.                                      He was also a flawed man. On a personal level, he compulsively and persistently cheated on his wife. He routinely plagiarized in academic settings, including in his PHD dissertation. As a leader, he could be indecisive and undisciplined. He was reckless in who he associated with.                                      Eig does a brilliant job pulling all this together to paint a fully rounded life. He has read everything, including the newly released FBI tapes and several newly discovered writings by associates of Doctor King. This is a full detailed life.                                      Eig hits exactly the right tone. At times he is unwinding difficult questions of what the evidence shows about issues like Communist tainted advisors around King or the wisdom of his campaign to bring his movement too Chicago. At other times, he is writing an epic. His description of the ""I Have a Dream Speech"", which intersperses the reactions of listeners, is powerful, and makes the speech new.                                      Eig also focuses on the role of Corretta Scott King. He gives a much fuller picture of her background and life. He emphasizes her importance as part of the movement, not just as a wife. At the same time, he shows the challenge of raising three kids in the middle of the hurricane which surrounded her husband.                                      The original campaigns were targeted against clear and discrete legal wrongs. Blacks had to sit at the back of the bus. Blacks couldn't vote. Blacks couldn't sit at a lunch counter. Blacks could not go to school with Whites. The causes were indisputable to any fair-minded person.                                      Eig shows that King insisted that the movement had to move North to fight racism there. The problems got much more complicated. The racism in the North wasn't created, primarily, by laws, it was created by customs and habits of racism. It was much harder to integrate private housing or to force employers to hire black workers. And suddenly white support in the North dwindled.                                      The last several years of King's life were dominated by his trying to solve that problem. At the same time, he was targeted by the FBI in a vicious attack designed to destroy him by leaking wiretaps of his sexual misconduct. J. Edgar Hoover considered him the most dangerous man in America.                                      Also, at the same time, he was increasingly coming under attack from Black radicals, most prominently Malcolm X, for being too moderate. He also triggered attacks from President Johnson and much of the establishment when he came out against the Vietnam War. King noted that it was disproportionality black soldiers dying in the war. White commentators insisted that he should stay out of foreign policy.                                      The last years of his life were a nonstop and exhausting schedule of protests, arrests, lawsuits, contentious meetings and attacks from every angle. Eig makes it clear that even in this maelstrom King remained calm and committed to his core principals of racial justice and nonviolence.                                      Dwight Gardner in his New York Times review of this book pointed out that students of this time period are very lucky. Robert Caro's biography of Johnson is a masterpiece. Beverly Gage's new recent biography of J. Edgar Hoover is astonishing. And now we have King in all his grandeur and complexity in this book. The intertwining alliances, betrayals and battles of Johnson, Hoover and King make an American tragedy worthy of Shakespear.","688 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","The first full biography in decades, King mixes revelatory and exhaustive new research with brisk and accessible storytelling to forge the definitive life for our times.

As far as I can tell, it is based on deep and wide research ably synthesised into a textured, unflinching, empathetic portrait. Previously I had had a vague understanding of how and why he was a great man, tinted by more recent attempts at overturning the modern myth and legend that draw attention to either his more radical, revolutionary side or his flaws, but there were so many things I hadn’t appreciated (many of which I’m sure are well-known to the better informed) about Martin Luther King: just how much Christianity drove him, his fluctuations in popularity and influence, how important the Vietnam war was to him, the depth of the stress and expectation and danger he endured, the context for his undeniable blind spots, the extent of his infidelity and how close that came to ruining him, the limitations of his abilities, the bleakness he felt at success and failure, the mixed nature of some of his successes within his lifetime, but the triumph of them too. At times I was aghast at mistakes and missed opportunities, but many more I was in awe of how devoted he was to the cause and how powerful the right man at the right time can be.                                      Overall, it's a very well written book. It gives good context for all the events and people involved (except maybe the Kennedys, but presumably that is not a problem for Americans) and I was never bored. I wish that there had been time and space for a longer epilogue that delved more deeply into both the post-1968 lives of the other people in Martin Luther King’s life, the practical legacy of his work, and his long term cultural impact, but I accept that that is at least a whole other book.                                       King                                      gave me a new appreciation of how the modern deification of Martin Luther King fails to do justice to the complexities of his philosophy or who he was as a person.","688 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","The first full biography in decades, King mixes revelatory and exhaustive new research with brisk and accessible storytelling to forge the definitive life for our times.

Yet there is a part of me that worries that another biography of King (even though it has been some time since the last one) further overshadows other key names in the civil rights movement whose contributions must not be overlooked. It is true that King and his philosophy of nonviolence dominated the movement for a number of years after he was placed at the head of the Birmingham Bus boycott in 1955. In part, it was chance that led to his role, but he was an excellent choice.                                      At the same time, it is also true that there were times when King and the other leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference sort of moved in on the territory of other civil rights groups and took over.                                      But with all of that said, this book is a remarkable window into the movement, King's thoughts and feelings, his family's support, and the lengths that enemies of the movement would go to - J. Edgar Hoover, I'm looking at you.                                      You can almost feel King's fatigue and frustration in the last five years of his life. He is dealing, not only with setbacks to civil rights for Blacks, in spite of the legislative wins in Congress, but also to resistance from almost all sides as he extends his desire for peace and nonviolence to protesting the Vietnam War long before it became cool to protest the war.                                      Civil Rights activist Julian Bond once sarcastically described the generally accepted myth of the civil rights movement in this way: ""Rosa sat down, Martin stood up, then the white folks saw the light and saved the day."" Even though Rosa Parks features prominently in the book, and Martin does a lot of standing, the book makes clear just how much more there was to it - the suffering and sacrifices of many people, including King.","688 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","The first full biography in decades, King mixes revelatory and exhaustive new research with brisk and accessible storytelling to forge the definitive life for our times.

If you think you already know all there is to know about Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., this book proves us wrong! As with Eig's other biographies, such as Ali: A Life - which I also highly recommend, this book is about Martin the Man - he was human, he was flawed, and he had deep compassion and humility. This book is meticulously researched and Eig had the benefit of being able to review recently released surveillance transcripts and tapes to really dive into what was happening in conversations and behind-the-scenes of key events. It also sheds light on the incredible harassment J. Edgar Hoover unleashed on King which only added to his incredible stress. As in all politics, LBJ leveraged his relationship with MLK Jr. as long as it was convenient for pushing his agenda (of course, he was pushing Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act -- so not bad things!) but as soon as MLK Jr. became more outspoken about the war in Vietnam, LBJ distanced himself from him. There is information about his extra-marital affairs but because Eig clearly centers this book on him as a human, we get to fully see his life, warts and all. This is what I appreciate about this book. The other lesson for us is we need to keep fighting because there are still incredible inequities and a covert and overt push to interfere with voting rights of BIPOC citizens in many states. We as humans need to take up the mantle of MLK Jr. and others who came before. I highly recommend this book.

I think many people right now are feeling a bit depressed at the way in which support for the cause of racial justice has waned after having enjoyed widespread and enthusiastic support after the murders of Trayvon Martin, George Floyd, and others. I found inspiration and encouragement in how Dr King pressed on in 1968 when his opposition to the war in Vietnam had driven a wedge between him and the American public, including many of his allies, donors, and collaborators. King was sincerely and profoundly a follower of Jesus Christ, and even when he was tired and expected to be killed, he pressed on. Even when others considered his immediate projects to be unwise, underfunded, underorganized, poorly planned, and likely to produce nothing but public humiliation, King placed his trust in a God who King felt had called him to the work. He could not stop.                                      You do not have to believe in God to admire the teachings of Jesus - lifting up the poor, blessing the peacemakers, loving even one's enemies, seeing all men and women as his equals and as brothers and sisters made in the image of the divine, and sacrificing his own comfort and even his life for these brothers and sisters, and for the cause of love and justice. Even an atheist can love the notion of a beloved community where all are welcome and all are equal, where everyone has enough, and where violence has been extinguished. Martin believed in a God who called him to work for the realization of that vision, and he responded to that call with all the courage and love that a man can muster.                                      It is common now to hear people, even MAGA folks, smile sweetly and talk about King, usually making reference to the Dream speech and particularly to a short phrase about the content of one's character. Then they go out and vote for racists who want to suppress black votes, cut social spending, and give tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy. Schools are as segregated now as they were in King's day, and inequality is worse. Mass incarceration - the new Jim Crow - developed after the death of King. Barack Obama insisted that there has been progress since the 60's, and he said that before the 2016 election. Before Americans took issue with the claim that Black Lives Matter. Even Obama's optimism and faith in America must have been shaken in recent years. I know mine has. But then you spend some time with Dr. King, and you see how human he was, how flawed in his personal behavior, and how he rose above all his doubts and anxieties to keep on pushing for peace, love, and justice for his people, for all of us. I found inspiration in his example. Perhaps you will too.                                      We are living at a time when being a Christian has come to mean being for guns and walls at the border, cuts in social spending and in lower taxes for the very well-off, persecution of anyone who isn't straight or cisgendered, a morality focused on sexual purity and punitive notions of justice, tolerance of vast social and economic inequality, a view of capitalism as divinely-inspired and of America as God's chosen and exceptional nation, a sense that Christians and white people are being persecuted and discriminated against, and an appalling openness to conspiracy theories. The Jesus who described the Kingdom of God as a condition in which the last are first, the poor and the peacemakers are blessed and happy, and who was executed by the state for such rabble-rousing seems better represented by King than by most Christians today.                                      Perhaps this book will inspire others who are thinking about how we can reenergize the pursuit of justice in America and come closer to the beloved community of King's vision for all of us, his people. I am not optimistic, but I have recovered some hope. Thank you, Martin.","688 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","The first full biography in decades, King mixes revelatory and exhaustive new research with brisk and accessible storytelling to forge the definitive life for our times.

This was one of the most captivating biographies I’ve ever read and at 600 pages… that’s saying a lot. Part oral history, race/critical theory, and a non fiction narrative that portrays MLK as human, textured, messy, and flawed.                                      40 years has gone by without a new biography for MLK. Perhaps because of the Obama era ushering in a false sense of security of “post racial America”which we were not and clearly will not be in for a long time, if ever.                                      Perhaps it’s more Eig’s aim to show that was never MLK’s end all be all… he was a man of faith. Which I never was really taught in school. He was also a man of extreme complexity and incredible nuance who chewed his fingernails, loved to dance, stayed up late talking, and suffered from depression.                                      I feel such a sadness after reading this. And hope. A figure like MLK existing is a gift but we have to stay active, be aware of our government’s surveillance, and not wait for heroes to step up to do the work for us. We are all able to effect change.

Paulson offers an interesting (and rarely seen) perspective as someone who made it to the top of the pyramid. She blends reporting and scholarship with memoir in a way that is true to her authorial voice. It's a fun read, even if, in the year of our four-part-investigative-docuseries 2023, there's nothing groundbreaking.                                      There were certain places where the narrative fell flat, relying on the very ""bossbabe"" rhetorical tactics she decries; she repeats how racist MLMs can be, without digging into what that practically means, and suggests she's stepping back from social media to take action in her community (against racism, I think), but again fails to expand on any actual effort she's undertaken. She repeats these talking points that are now pretty common across social media threads, but doesn't sufficiently unpack them or their impact on her experience (if any). The pithy subtitle suggests there will be a detailed takedown, but Paulson maintains a decidedly moderate stance; she does not leave the MLM, coasting on the work of her downline and pulling in $15k/month. This was probably the part that felt the most out of touch. She expresses guilt for encouraging people to stick with it because it will help her bottom line while explaining that she had to get rid of the au pair.                                      I do have more significant reservations. As the book closes, Paulson suggests that she is out of the MLM life for good because she now recognizes its harm. She has instead turned her attention to life/sobriety coaching, which she admits can be a predatory field. She suggests that her certificate program was rigorous, but fails to name it. She then launches her newest venture, a paid subscription service to help sober moms find support and community (hang on...isn't that exactly how she said people got lured into MLMs?). This final sales pitch just hit me wrong and rang hollow. You can take the woman out of the MLM, but you can't take the boss out of the babe.

While I did come to this book already knowing how predatory MLMs are, how most people end up losing money, and how cult-like they are, it was great getting the perspective of somebody who had first hand knowledge. Emily Lynn Paulson was actually one of the few people able to rise to the top of her MLM, so it was very fascinating to read about her journey from becoming fully indoctrinated to realizing how messed up the company was to finally leaving it all behind.                                      I think this book does a great job showing how women get sucked into these companies and why they’re so attractive to a certain demographic of people. While a lot of the book is focused on Emily’s own experience, she also brings in quotes from other former MLM consultants, and data and research from other sources. The book mostly feels like a memoir with some additional information about the MLM industry as a whole.                                      The whole thing was so compelling, I listened to the book in 2 days because I was fully invested. Because she’s coming at this from the perspective of somebody who was involved in an MLM and brought so many other people into it, she does have compassion for the women who are involved in MLMs. This isn’t a brutal takedown with no considerations for why women end up trapped in these companies. Of course she is very critical, but there is also an understanding that a lot of these women are victims in addition to being perpetrators. In the end some of the topics and events started to feel a bit rushed, but overall this was a great read.                                      I definitely recommend checking this one out if it sounds interesting to you!

I was exposed to my first MLM as a child when my mom would be invited to all of the parties ~ Pampered Chef, Creative Memories, Tupperware and so many more. I obviously didn't understand it all at the time, but I do always remember the reps pushing the guests hard to host their own parties and my mom always buying at least one thing because she felt guilty if she didn't. Fast forward to my own adulthood when I was the one being invited to the parties and being encouraged to host my own parties or become a consultant ""just for the discount alone!"".                                      The experience that sticks with me the most though is when I was at my most vulnerable. I was 25 with a newborn and had no friends with babies. I was at Target with my baby and a woman my age (also with a baby) started talking to me (                                       in the baby aisle - she was lying in wait!!! So gross.                                      ) and I was so overjoyed to have found someone to talk to. She seemed so interested in me and wanted to get together to chat and I could already envision our babies growing up together while the two of us grew to be best friends. Or not. On my first visit to her house, her and her husband made it apparent that this was not a social visit and that they wanted to bring me into their lifestyle ~ a lifestyle that involved groceries and home goods that I could buy from them to change my life. Somehow they also ended up at my house pitching to me and my husband about joining their team and thank goodness my husband was thinking more clearly than I was and ended things quickly with a ""thanks but no thanks"" and sent them on their way. I never heard from her again. This memory came rushing back to me while reading this book because I was at a point where I was so desperate for connection that I would have signed anything to have a friend who was also at home with a baby and able to talk to me during the day.                                      That's what Emily Lynn Paulson hits home in                                       Hey, Hun                                      ~ MLMs prey on people just like me, and it's intentional and brutal.                                       Paulson has written a memoir that reads like a juicy domestic fiction novel but also managed to fill it with so much information about MLM's, cults and the psychology of marketing. Come for the dirt and stay for the education. I so appreciate her sobriety story as well, although that is just a small part of this book. She spills the tea (hers and that of the industry) without sugarcoating her own culpability in the manipulation and financial ruin of so many women. I admire her bravery and honesty in speaking out, and also the grace in which she speaks about current MLM members who aren't yet able to see the light. I highly recommend this book.

2023-07-03,"Hey, Hun: Sales, Sisterhood, Supremacy, and the Other Lies Behind Multilevel Marketing",,Emily Lynn Paulson,4.04,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Feminism', 'Cults', 'Business', 'Politics']",Kindle $12.99,Danielle,Rating 3 out of 5,"May 5, 2023","A former boss babe is here to give us a behind-the-scenes look at MLMs and I was SO here for it! As someone who has been targeted by them on the Book of Faces, they annoy me and I am always mystified by how intelligent people get sucked into this. I'm on the MLM subreddit she mentions in the book and a Hun is always doing something outrageous. I also recently read Cultish, which is also mentioned.                                      As a free market champion, it frequently confuses people that I am anti-MLM. I do not think it should be part of a free market as it is unsustainable and predatory. I found the meritocracy conversation she brought up interesting.                                      Once someone joins an MLM, I don't know how to feel around them because suddenly they sound cult-like in their beliefs and as someone who isn't religious, it disturbs me because I then feel like nothing they say is true. It is strange that many of the people involved are Christians until you realize they are guilty of plenty of hypocrisies far worse than pretending to be interested in my current skincare routine. Far more predatory is what some of the Huns try to dangle in front of those of us with chronic illness, promising healing, health, and prosperity. It's very ableist and nasty.                                      I have cringed alone for far too long over this so I was happy to get my hands on this book but I have to say I was disappointed. I knew that the author was going to attempt to link MLMs to white supremacy, but I didn't think it would be a recurring theme and I just didn't find the argument persuasive. Every few chapters, she put in a woke diatribe denouncing her privilege like a Robin DiAngelo speech and making another failed link to the Klan.                                      Look, I'm not a fragile cracker. I do not pretend privilege doesn't exist, or that racism is dead in this world. I do not think the world is colorblind. My eyes are open to all of the injustices. I acknowledge the sins of our ancestors, but my ancestors were not selling It Works! or Avon.

2023-07-03,"Hey, Hun: Sales, Sisterhood, Supremacy, and the Other Lies Behind Multilevel Marketing",,Emily Lynn Paulson,4.04,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Feminism', 'Cults', 'Business', 'Politics']",Kindle $12.99,Sam Wescott,Rating 3 out of 5,"June 20, 2023","Hmm. I think this author thinks that she came across as more sympathetic then she actually did. The first half of the book was really interesting. I liked seeing how the author originally got involved in the MLM and how she was able to rise to the top so quickly. In general, I thought this book was best when it was the most specific. I really loved the snippets of testimonials from former MLM representatives at the beginning of each chapter. Honestly, I would’ve liked more of those.                                      The author did lose me in the second half of the book. It was really hard to maintain my interest in her personal life and internal struggle when she openly admits that she knew the company she was working for was unethically structured, but continued to profit from it. She admits that she was making as much as and sometimes more than 40K per paycheck while she knew people in her downline were either making no profit or actively adding to their debt. It made it very hard to sympathize with her while she repeatedly delayed leaving the MLM and for several years, her active rebellion was to do less work, and “put rejuvenate on auto pilot“ while letting her downlink risk and lose more and more money and still recruit people.                                      Eventually, she did leave and she did write this book which I think will reach a specific segment of white women in her class strata. But I’m not sure it has a lot of reach beyond that and there are an awful lot of MLM critiques and resources that are available for free online, and now she gets to be a bit of a martyr. Idk, I just feel kinda weird about the whole thing.                                      And honestly, I think it was chickenshit of her to use a fake name for the MLM. By all means, protect the identity of the individuals that you’re talking about by changing names and combining details. But the company deserves to be put on blast so that other people can protect themselves.                                      With all of that said, and I know it was a lot, I did finish this book and only two days which says a lot about its consumable prose and conversational writing style. Parts of it are very juicy and again I thought the parts that were the most specific were the most useful. I was really interested in the parts of the book that get into how MLM’s rigged their finances. Surprisingly, I found the sections on expenses and profit loss statements to be some of the most interesting parts of the book. And the authors struggle with substance abuse disorder was legitimately emotional and well written. Although, I have reservations about her remaining in the coaching space which she admits is also made up of grifters. She claims to actually be trained, but doesn’t list any of her credentials and at this point I don’t really trust her.                                      I also feel like the sensitivity readers may have had a heavy hand in sections of this book, which I appreciate, but weren’t written to sound successfully authentic from the author.                                      I didn’t hate the book and I don’t hate the author, but I did find a lot of this book frustrating. I think it will find the most traction in the hands of readers most like the author, namely centrist wealthy white moderates. For that audience, I think it will be a gentle pressure in the right direction, but I think it will have limited utility elsewhere and left me personally feeling a grumpy.","384 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","She signed up for the sisterhood, free cars, and the promise of a successful business of her own.

I hate MLMs. I think they take advantage of people (mostly women) who are in various states of distress. They don't make their lives better and they don't make them rich. Sure, maybe one or two make some money but the vast majority get caught in a cycle of chasing the money they already lost. I could go on, but it would be easier to just read Hey, Hun by Emily Lynn Paulson.                                      This book does something a lot of anti-MLM documentaries don't. This book feels like a day by day walk-through of the soul-crushing life of a ""consultant"" for an MLM. I have no come across something which so thoroughly explains how even the people who seem to be winning in an MLM are still being victimized. Sure, most of us know that MLMs are bad, but did you know the ""free"" car many of them tout is far from free. Paulson explains how the car like many of aspects of the glamorous MLM life are really just another way to lose money.                                      Another aspect is the emotional manipulation rampant in this culture and how the people within it are often brainwashed and feel trapped when they start to see the light. This may be the most effective part of the narrative. Paulson is not a crusader. She knows and admits openly that she benefited significantly from her experience. However, she actively avoids criticizing the people within MLMs. They are victims and perpetrators. The system is on trial in this book.                                      There are other less successful narrative threads. We know MLMs are very white. The connection between this and white supremacy is not discussed enough to feel fully fleshed out. The pandemic politics discussion at the end of the book feels a bit rushed and tacked on when it could probably be eliminated entirely. These are minor quibbles when considering how much the book gets right.                                      (This book was provided as an advance copy by Netgalley and Row House Publishing.

But goddamn was it a chore to read. Paulson summarizes huge chunks of her 6-year career in single paragraphs, such as the story of her recoveries from alcoholism and cancer. The book swings wildly between memoir and polemic, making it read like a 300-page tangent. Former MLM adherents will cheer, but the book is too lacking in focus and detail to have any value for a current MLM seller trying to understand what they've gotten themselves into. It's also extremely pander-y – Paulson attacks ""late-stage capitalism"" before going after ""government spending"" a few chapters later, and also name-drops ""white supremacy"" without ever examining what that means for the people impacted by it. Finally, Paulson never fully reckons with the late-career passive income she made off the backs of the women working under her, nor the impact that her chronic absence had on her five children. The book treats them as forgettable, just like MLM does.                                      Let's celebrate MLM getting overdue scrutiny, mourn the fact that it had to start with a book like this.","384 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","She signed up for the sisterhood, free cars, and the promise of a successful business of her own.

2023-07-03,"Hey, Hun: Sales, Sisterhood, Supremacy, and the Other Lies Behind Multilevel Marketing",,Emily Lynn Paulson,4.04,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Feminism', 'Cults', 'Business', 'Politics']",Kindle $12.99,Amy,Rating 5 out of 5,"May 23, 2023","This memoir will be available on May 30th, and Emily will be featured on the Book Gang podcast next month.                                      ****                                      Emily's beginnings in an MLM company may look familiar to you. It starts with loneliness and the need for belonging. As a new mother, she is thrilled when an old friend invites her out for a glass of wine but realizes that this evening of friendship also includes a display table of products and a promised sisterhood.                                      So, after going through the high-pressure sales routine (where she only needs to buy the starter pack), she joins the #girlboss community for an MLM beauty brand. But, before she has even made it home to tell her husband she’s made a purchase, it has been blasted all over Facebook that she has joined the official team, a job entry that is both bewildering and aggressive.                                      It’s no secret that Paulson is lonely, and statistical data shows that this is just the kind of person an MLM targets. She shares that studies show that 90 percent of new moms consider themselves lonely, and 54 percent consider themselves friendless. These companies promise not only a paycheck where you can work from home but also promise friendship, travel, and nights out. What could be better than that?                                      What Emily needs to know, and what few women know, though, is that over 90 percent of them will not make a dime, and only five-hundredths of a percent of the women will achieve the degree of success advertised by these companies.                                      For Paulson, it requires her never to take no for an answer and to do anything she can to rise to the top of the pyramid. It's the start of many cringe-worthy moments for the reader, but by paycheck standards, it ultimately works. She does, indeed, become a success.                                      While this success initially feels hard-won, she later must acknowledge that collecting a check is incredibly easy when you recruit enough people to do the work for you. As a result, Paulson achieves millionaire status, but it costs her the expense of loved ones, her sobriety, her health, and her moral compass.                                      Ultimately, Paulson's memoir serves as a warning to others about the dangers of MLMs and the importance of compassion for those caught up in them. With biting commentary, Paulson expertly lays out the role of MLMs in the cultural epidemic of isolation and the cult-like ideologies that course through their training, marketing, and one-on-one interactions.                                      More importantly, Paulson's sobriety awakened her because she thought less about the consequences or the manipulative things she did when she was drunk. Still, you can't turn a blind eye when you are sober. The way that all comes to a head is in a spectacular blaze you must read to believe.                                      Using a fictitious company name and pointing to the company's cult-like philosophies humanizes anyone attracted to these pyramid schemes. The women involved aren't villains; they are victims. It also provides incredible insight into these companies' troubling and predatory history, acknowledging her own troubled involvement in the manipulation and financial harm inflicted upon countless women.                                      Her courage in sharing her story is admirable, and she acknowledges that publishing this story was difficult. However, it raises questions about why the world still seems afraid to address the continued predatory nature of these companies and the women who become entrapped in them. What will be gained by our silence, and who, ultimately, profits from it?

But I can’t shake the feeling that scammers are gonna scam…                                      Throughout the book, I got the sense that Emily was embellishing the amount of skepticism and snark she claims to have felt all along her journey to the top of the MLM pyramid. It’s like she wants the reader to know she wasn’t ever like “the other boss babes.” Lots of “I rolled my eyes” or “I can’t believe how cheesy this is.”                                      Yet, if it’s true that she always knew how messed up everything was, that only makes her stint as a MLM lady boss seem all the more predatory.                                      The cherry on top of the scam sundae is that by 3/4ths through the book, Emily is completely disenchanted and disgusted with the entire industry—she talks about how the problem with knowledge is that once you have it, you can’t un-have it—yet she still stays in the MLM for months (or years? the timeline is unclear) after that, passively collecting thousands of dollars per month on the backs of women below her.                                      It seems she stayed just long enough to get her next potentially predatory business up and running: a paid platform for her addiction recovery coaching services and a community for sober moms. She all but acknowledges that “coaching” is the new MLM scamming, but again, she’s not like the *other* coaches. She has earned rigorous—but wholly unnamed—certification credentials. And the kicker? Her new coaching group is called the “Sober Mom Squad.” This, after having spent an entire book mocking the infantilizing, cheesy names and slogans that MLMs and their members use. Again, she wants us to believe that she’s not like the other girl gangs, hustle tribes, or lady bosses, etc.                                      Look, I do not think Emily or other women like her should be crucified for their conduct in MLMs. As she acknowledges herself, she was both a victim and a perpetrator. But she also acknowledges that she came from a place of privilege, even at the very beginning of her MLM journey. She had much less to lose, and, by the end, she was knowingly profiting off women who were losing everything. She never really reckons with that fact.                                      It also felt like there were a lot of buzzwords added into the text—possibly by her publisher or the sensitivity readers she mentions in the acknowledgments—that were left unexplained or at least not explained in any meaningful way. Emily never really elaborates on how she goes from all-in, girl boss extraordinaire, to someone who regularly uses terms like intersectional feminism, BIPOC, and extra-judicial police killing. She critiques women who just mindlessly regurgitate the rhetoric of others on social media, but I felt the book was missing an explanation for when and how she came to appreciate these concepts. If she knew them all along during her MLM ascension—again, yikes. But if she delved into and learned about them in the process of leaving the MLM or writing this book, she never said so. That would have been something worth exploring.","384 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","She signed up for the sisterhood, free cars, and the promise of a successful business of her own.

The biggest qualm I have is the way the author repeatedly made comments on the pervasiveness of white supremacy in the MLM world, but doesn’t offer more than a surface level definition of what the term means. She is quick to criticize the rampant racism and alt-right, extremist mentality of many in the industry, but doesn’t actually offer any explanation of efforts she has undertaken to deconstruct her own white privilege or her complacency in this culture. At best, the frequent mention of white supremacy, racism and privilege sound more like lip service than anything else: a white woman commenting on these issues because that’s what is expected in the current contemporary climate. All the reflections come across as majorly self-congratulatory. Paulson says she is not apolitical, but almost speaks of her hyper-moderate stance as though it’s some kind of flex.                                      I came into this expecting a scathing takedown of a morally and ethically corrupt industry, but even in this, Paulson’s teeters on the edge of moderate to indifferent. She does not leave the MLM for some time, says she doesn’t buy into the mentality any more, but in the same breath explains how she coasted on the efforts of her down line for months in order to continue making thousands per month. while she does feign acknowledgment for the guilt she feels, she narrates from a very “holier-than-thou” position that really didn’t sit well with me.","384 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","She signed up for the sisterhood, free cars, and the promise of a successful business of her own.

Hate. MLM's. I hate them. Hate hate hate hate hate.                                      I have been known to spend 10 or 20 bucks on nail wraps or organic room spray or whatever if you're my friend or a relative, just because I love you, but quite frankly, I would rather have a root canal that host a makeup party. I do not want to spend $60 on a made-in-a-Nepali-sweatshop t-shirt dress. And I certainly don't want to sit through a recruitment Zoom on a Tuesday night when I could be doing...oh, I dunno... LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE.                                      SO, in short, this book just confirmed everything I already thought/felt about MLM's -- they're pyramid schemes made with aspartame instead of real sugar to skirt under the line of legality, just as appealing and just as bad for you. Paulson hits on the uniquely American problem of motherhood: that we love to say it takes a village, but then there is no village to be found. American mothers are exhausted, lonely, and adrift, drowning in the mental load of motherhood, until that sketchy DM appears (""Hi beautiful! Been a while! We should get coffee - would love to catch up and discuss an awesome business opportunity if you're free!"") that seems to offer her a life preserver of friendship and community AND a chance to earn money.                                      Don't do it, babes. That life preserver is actually a leech. I don't know what the answer is to our culture's weird neglect of moms, but MLM's ain't it.                                      Emily Lynn Paulson tempers her anger with humor and empathy, and this book is every bit as entertaining as it is infuriating.","384 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","She signed up for the sisterhood, free cars, and the promise of a successful business of her own.

I’ve heard about the “Hey, Hun” phenomenon with regards to MLMs and social media, and wanted to read an account from someone who was once a participant. Emily’s memoir absolutely met my expectations and then some. She didn’t shy away from describing her time in an MLM, rising through the ranks, then becoming disillusioned and her path to leave.                                      The narrative arc was well done and I did not want to put this book down once I started it. I made time to read it because the subject matter was intriguing. Emily bares her flaws in order to show how MLMs take advantage of people, and keep them on the hook to spend more money and recruit more people. She spends time exploring the reasons she was susceptible to the tactics used to get and keep her involved, and explains how and why she brushed aside concerns during her tenure before finally calling it quits.                                      The connections to white supremacy felt far-fetched to me at times, but perhaps there were just some gaps in the writing as to how she came to her conclusions. I absolutely agree that white supremacy is an issue in MLMs, capitalism, etc. but there were times when I was reading this that it felt added in to make a point or somewhat repetitive. There were some sections where the exploration of white supremacy was clearly demonstrated in the MLM activities she described and well worth including. The discussions of sales and sisterhood flowed a little better in the reading. I’m glad that Emily took on these hard topics though and appreciate her willingness to speak up about them.                                      The resource lists included at the end of the book were very helpful and I’ve added several books to my list to read on the topic of MLMs.                                      Emily is raw, honest and unflinching in this memoir. I would like to see more memoirs of this nature. Emily’s desire to raise awareness and help others is evident in this book and her other pursuits. This was a fast read and I recommend it for anyone interested in memoirs, MLMs and cults.","384 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","She signed up for the sisterhood, free cars, and the promise of a successful business of her own.

You're making money off the backs of people in the name of female empowerment. You're not leaving a legacy or making an impact. You're recruiting people into a failed system so you can rank up and make more money.                                       Emily Lynn Paulson achieved the nearly-unachievable for a consultant in an MLM: She made it nearly to the tip-top of the pyramid, getting touted as a million-dollar earner (before taxes), winning a ""free"" car, and receiving five-digit paychecks every month.                                       Hey, Hun                                      is the story of why she did it, how she did it, and why she chose to give it all up.                                      First things first, I should admit this: About six years ago, I myself was part of an MLM (the leggings one -- you probably already know most of what I experienced if you've watched the                                       Lularich                                      documentary). Thankfully I didn't get in deep enough to recruit a giant team or lose my entire savings before I nope'd outta there, but I could definitely relate to a lot of what Emily talks about in                                       Hey, Hun                                      : the cult-like ideology, the conditional sisterhood, the emotional manipulation, feeling tied to your phone to fulfill the constant need to do and be and display more. Emily wasn't part of my particular                                       cult                                      MLM, but it doesn't matter: They all employ the same structures and strategies to recruit, manipulate, indoctrinate, and exploit.                                      In brutally honest, bitingly funny terms, Emily exposes the predatory nature of MLMs, how they employ toxic positivity, emotional manipulation, and false promises to target vulnerable women and then shame them into staying, even as they are hemorrhaging money and fracturing their real-life relationships.                                       Hey, Hun                                      reads like an exposé as Emily takes us down the rabbit hole of her experiences in her dual role as victim and perpetrator, sharing all facets of her #bossbabe life...including her spiral into alcoholism, perpetuated by the pressures of her MLM ""career."" The book is strongest when it's focused on Emily's personal journey, but less so when she brings social issues into the story; the claims of white supremacy within MLMs feel forced and unsupported, and while it was interesting to hear how the MLM world responded to COVID, I could have dealt without the rehashing of the fraught political situation at that time.                                      I really enjoyed this overall, though, and appreciated how frank and vulnerable Emily was in the telling of her story. If you've ever been a consultant for or a customer of an MLM, or even just if you're curious as to what an MLM looks like from within, I think you'll find                                       Hey, Hun                                      fascinating and illuminating.

You’re not brave. But you are a victim—a victim of financial exploitation, a victim of toxic positivity, and for many of us, victims of our own white supremacy. Because this constant push for personal development is actually just a symptom of a world that requires perfection to be in community—and perfection in this context is defined by white, Christian, upper-middle-class women.”                                      I received an ARC of this and tore through it in a few days! I will admit- a lot of the information is that which I already knew- but that’s only because I’m a “citizen detective” when it comes to cultic and religious studies 🤣Emily is a recovered member of MLM giant “Rejuvinat” (a pseudonym) who climbed the ladder of girlbossing until, simply put, she could girlboss no more. Having Emily pull back the curtain on the processes of “business” employed by these groups- from the social media posting to conventions- was fascinating, and worth the read alone.                                      I want to provide a disclaimer- I see a lot of people online critiquing this book because they feel the author’s previous use of her own story for financial gain is so despicable, that she shouldn’t be given any more air time. I feel strongly that most things in this life are nuanced, and in this case, the author has journeyed through girlboss hell and back again. What she has to offer us as a consolation for supposed “bad behavior”, then, is her first person account of experience and growth through it all. I think that Paulson’s radical honesty, vulnerability of portraying herself as flawed, and willingness to call out her own part in perpetuating the toxicity of all aspects of MLM culture are all grounds for commendation. Emily isn’t perfect, and neither are any of us. There is a lot of value in her story- and through her opening the door, hopefully many others will walk through to tell their own stories.

I think Emily’s intentions with writing this book are good and the information she is sharing is incredibly needed. I agree with her assessments, but I think starting the book off by saying that she is a pretty white woman and being very explicit about her privilege made this book feel like it came from the wrong person. I’m not saying that if you don’t NEED the money from this book and you feel sorry for profiting off of and taking advantage of people you could ensure that all of the proceeds from the book go to helping women get out of and pay debts incurred by similar organizations to yours. AND ANOTHER THING, how are you not just saying which mlm you were a part of. It feels off to me. Like why are you protecting them?                                      It feels like when Joshua Harris from “I kissed dating goodbye” wrote a book on how to deconstruct and sold it to all of the people whose lives he fucked up.                                      Like being in a cult is very very bad and it changes your brain, but being rich in one it’s less bad than being poor in one. Right? Am I a piece of shit for pointing that out?                                      It freaks me out how naturally she manipulates people inside of the cult and how candidly she talks about it.

She states she doesn't like to get political but then offers views and opinions on politics through the book in an offhanded fashion that doesn't support or further any argument or context.

Additionally, she uses ""white supremacy"" throughout the book but doesn't explain how MLMs encompass this.

IS. SO. GOOD.                                      So juicy.                                      I loved it.                                      Full Review:                                      This book is a memoir that provides a scatching insider's critique of the Multi-Level Marketing industry. Emily Lynn Paulson, a former rep for a company called ""Rejuvinat"" (not the real name) where she made her way up to the top 0.5%. This memoir looks at everything in her journey, from the circumstances that made her consider selling in the first place all the way up to her departure from the company and the subsequent consequences and reflections.                                      And Paulson doesn't hold back. She talks here about the recruiting processes, conventions, social media presence, and pressures to conform to the norms of the company during her time as a consultant. She talks about how she was pressured to post aspirational (and misleading) social media content in order to recruit new consultants in her downline, how her compensation was very dependent on the pyramid structure of the company, and how much of her money just filtered right back into her job through attending conventions, purchasing products to acheive sales goals, and and buying gifts for her downline. She even discusses how the ""free"" car she earned wasn't as ""free"" as it appeared.                                      It basically confirmed everything I felt like is really happening behind the scenes when my Facebook friends start selling these types of products.                                      The general idea here is that Paulson explains how MLMs work very much like cults, which is an argument that I've seen before (and agree with), but was happy to see fully fleshed out here with tons of details from an insider. It works particularly well here because Paulson made it so far in the company -- she was actually successful, but still paints a picture of why these companies are destined to fail...even for ""successful"" participants. Paulson applies lenses of gender and social class successful to her analysis of her own story, which was probably my favorite aspect -- she really talks about why white upper middle class women are particularly vulnerable to these companies, and why that is harmful. She does consider race in her discussion, though that discussion is a little bit less sucessful as it is more of a surface-level analysis, since she is a white woman and can't really speak on minority experiences from an insider perspective.                                      As this is a memoir, Paulson also covers her personal journey with her family and her own alcholism as she gets deeper and deeper into her ""business.""                                      This memoir is as juicy, if not juicier, than I expected and I FLEW through it. I read it both on audiobook and in print, and both were a delight -- the audiobook narration was seemless and felt like listening to a long-form podcast giving me all the dirt on these scammy companies. I highly recommend this to anyone who has ever been approached by a hun on Facebook...it's definitely worth the read.","384 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","She signed up for the sisterhood, free cars, and the promise of a successful business of her own.

2023-07-03,"Hey, Hun: Sales, Sisterhood, Supremacy, and the Other Lies Behind Multilevel Marketing",,Emily Lynn Paulson,4.04,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Feminism', 'Cults', 'Business', 'Politics']",Kindle $12.99,Ameema S.,Rating 4 out of 5,"May 18, 2023","4.5 stars                                      This was a compelling, compulsively readable memoir/“tell-all” that read almost like a thriller. Emily Lynn Paulson is very obviously a great storyteller. I was intrigued by the concept, but wasn’t expecting to be so completely hooked so quickly.                                      This was a smart, thoughtful, critical exploration of MLMs (multilevel marketing schemes/companies) and specifically of the author’s own experiences within an MLM. She does a great job breaking down and exploring the many different structure (not all of them pyramid-shaped, haha) that make MLMs possible, and successful. White supremacy, Racism, predatory behaviours, MLMs are rife with them, and Paulson dove into this in a way that was both salacious and fascinating, but also really human and empathetic.                                      It’s hard to critique a memoir, obviously it takes a lot to write your own story. And most often you are not the villain of it, so it makes sense that the author won’t be their own harshest critic. This book (for me) brought up some interesting thoughts about how complicit you are when you’re involved in a system that draws you in at your own most vulnerable, and then makes you turn around and prey upon other vulnerable people. I think the author touched on it a bit, and while no one owes anyone their story, I think more of an internal reckoning, and more acknowledgment of their own accountability would have helped me connect a bit more with the story. Obviously this story is told through the benefit of hindsight, so the “villains” and “mean girls” were clear (almost cartoonishly), and the empathy our author had was                                       not like other #BossBabes                                      - but the book (like MLMs) does skirt around responsibility a bit, specially the author’s own. I find it really notable how much the author made clear that they were not political, and how much they iterated that they toed the middle line (not too far left and not too far right) politically, yet they also made a point to talk about race, racism, and white supremacy in a way that made them seem like one of the only people in their world who is brave and antiracist enough to speak out. Obviously there are a lots of shades of grey, and I’m personally very opposed to binary perspectives, so I did appreciate the author’s honesty about their political moderation. However, it felt worth noting… Perhaps I will always have a healthy amount of skepticism to any white woman who tells me about their braveness in the face of white supremacy.                                      That being said - overall, this book was a really human and sympathetic way of looking at the cult of MLMs, and the very human, and very flawed people within them.                                      I received an audiobook of this book, from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for my honest feedback.","384 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","She signed up for the sisterhood, free cars, and the promise of a successful business of her own.

From the very start, I was hooked.                                      Writing is one of my favorite hobbies. It has been ever since I was in grade school. So, when I heard about Sepetys upcoming nonfiction book? It was an instant pre-order. (And since I was pre-ordering from Parnassus, I went ahead and requested that my copy be personalized/signed by the author.)                                      There are so many great quotes, some of which I typed in my status updates, and the advice she gave for the different subjects are so memorable, especially ones that I hadn't come across before until now.                                      In fact, as someone who does not like writing in her books, I went ahead and ordered translucent post-it notes, so I could stick them in places to either underline or jot down my thoughts and ideas. I had my notebook beside me, ready to tackle down some of the writing prompts Sepetys provided at the end of each section.

The audiobook, read by the author herself, was perfection. Music not only played before each new subject, but it also set the tone. And Sepetys herself was a lovely narrator; her performance never once was lacking.

Of course! It's why Sepetys' new book, a departure from her historical fiction, STILL has all of her voice but also now her RANGE as a writer because she's talking directly to the reader: telling us about her life and how it matters when she writes her stories and how it should matter to you when you write YOUR story. It's uplifting and lighthearted even if the topics she weaves in and out of are not always especially when it comes to disappointment or rejection (or the awkward superlative she won during HS graduation).                                      The book is easy to follow and has natural breaks for each focus (plot, character, etc.) but then she also throws in factoids and questions-- so many questions-- that you're constantly pausing to answer her as if she's talking to you. This easy flow works so well for the unconfident writer in all of us.                                      However does she do it?                                      Memorable stories include Ten Ten and her (Snow) and her poop cocoon in addition, I'll always feel bad thinking about her when she has to fly. And that cover and opening lines about the tree!                                      Quotes from ARC:                                      ""When did the diary die? Was it suffocated with a pillow when I wasn't looking? A friend informed me that the journal has replaced the diary. Impossible!""                                      ""Ann Patchett once said, 'Why is it that we understand playing the cello will require work, but we attribute writing to the magic of inspiration?'""                                      ""How are you framing your memories and your personal stories?""                                      ""Fast forward many years.

Part memoir and part guidebook, Sepetys walks the reader through the elements of creating a story worth reading with elements of plots, characters, dialogue, conflict, and more. To explain each of these elements, Sepetys draws from stories in their own life, giving colorful examples of the ways your own experiences can inform your writing and story-building.                                      What I loved: Although I am not a writer myself, I found this book to be incredibly entertaining and intriguing. The memoir-like insertions in each section really drew me in, and I am now endlessly fascinated by Sepetys's life - they have so many stories to tell! The point of it is really about how you can use your personal experiences to craft a story, but I think it also points out how our experiences inform us as readers as well. As a reviewer, I found this to be really educational about all the things that go into writing and the elements of what makes a story that a reader could consider ""good"" - and why. For instance, the difference between showing and telling when it comes to character development, and the way that specific information about characters can really allow the reader to connect with them on another level.                                      The conversational tone and inclusion of guiding questions and examples make this very informative, and I found it to be an educational experience. As a non-writer, I was not sure how much I would get into this book, but I absolutely devoured it! The memoir-style writing throughout transformed this into something other than just a simple how-to guide and made it a read that anyone can enjoy. One of my favorite stories was of the way Sepetys redecorated their room as a teen (I won't give more details to avoid spoilers)- I was laughing out loud for that one and found it quite relatable, but there were so many engaging vignettes throughout!                                      Final verdict: YOU: THE STORY is a highly engaging and informative nonfiction book about writing that made me laugh, sigh, and cry out with the memoir-style elements, truly making this a read that will entertain writers and non-writers alike!

It was an uncorrected proof and there were SO many typos and formatting issues in the digital copy that made it very hard to keep reading for me. But focusing just on the subject matter, I think it could be good for a beginning writer who would like to find prompts to get inspired in your writing. Sepetys included some stories from her life that related to the prompts and that was very interesting to read. I will say that the pacing and organization of the book felt off to me. It felt a little all over the place as there’s prompts and life stories and research questions and it felt like she was trying to cram every single thing she could think of about writing into 1 book. But again, taking a subjective look at her writing advice, I do think it’s a valuable book for the beginning writer. Each chapter focuses on a different aspect of writing, setting, characters, plot, etc. I believe it’s geared toward young adults, but writers of any age can use this book and find value from the advice.","224 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 23, 2023","The nonfiction debut by #1                                 New York Times                                bestselling and Carnegie Medal-winning author Ruta Sepetys.

She covers so many elements of writing that this feels comprehensive in that sense, but the majority of the book involves Sepetys's personal stories, so the actual writing advice is fairly basic. Still, I found the stories entertaining, and I enjoyed the memoir element. I also liked the unusual writing prompts, which typically presented interesting facts and then left you hanging, telling you to research or imagine more and write a story based on it.                                      I liked the emphasis on mining your own experience to develop stories, especially since that has been such a huge part of my life. However, the author's experiences are so dramatic, quirky, and unusual that people can easily think that this doesn't apply to them, since they haven't had such a fascinating life. I wish the author had made it clearer that you don't need to have a dramatic, unconventional, unusual life full of unique opportunities in order to write well or discover great writing ideas.                                      I feel especially strongly about this because this is young adult nonfiction. It makes marketing sense for this to be YA, since the author writes YA novels, but the vast majority of the stories and life reflections Sepetys shares are from her adult life. There's some good stuff about her childhood and teenage years, but she didn't do enough to direct this book to people who haven't had adult experiences yet. If someone is twenty-five and building their career after college, they'll have way more ability to connect to this than someone who is still in high school, reading about a world they're not in. I know that I would have enjoyed the stories in high school, but not as much as I did now, and I would have felt frustrated that so little of this had to do with my current stage of life.","224 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 23, 2023","The nonfiction debut by #1                                 New York Times                                bestselling and Carnegie Medal-winning author Ruta Sepetys.

As a huge fan of her five YA historical fiction novels, I was so excited to find out that she was releasing a craft book on writing. You: The Story gives writers tips for crafting a story inspired by their life experiences. As some of you may know, I recently launched my freelance editing career, and as a developmental editor, I found this book filled with wonderful knowledge and exercises.                                      The feature that I enjoyed the most was the personal tone of the book. Sepetys shares her own life experiences (which are utterly wild in the best possible way) to demonstrate how to add meaning and depth to writing. Her stories were both hysterical and heartrending (look at me using those “H” words she talks about!). I found myself laughing and crying at quite a few of them.                                      Additionally, I appreciated that the book was written for people who don’t necessarily have experience with writing or editing. It covers introductory material for a wide range of topics, including plot, dialogue, setting, etc. This made it very easy to apply Sepetys’ techniques and makes it the perfect book for editors to use with their clients.                                      Finally, the layout of the book was well-thought-out. There are writing exercises throughout that help writers practice the techniques Sepetys discusses. There are also recaps for each chapter, which summarize the main ideas nicely. As a whole, the formatting was very user-friendly.                                      All in all, I cannot recommend this book enough! Whether you’re an aspiring author or an editor, this book has essential information on the writing process. The fact that it encourages writers to draw inspiration from their lives only adds to its power. Honestly, I’ve never really wanted to write a book myself, but after reading this one, it’s something that I would consider doing in the future. In the meantime, I will certainly reference You: The Story with my clients and use it to help guide them.","224 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 23, 2023","The nonfiction debut by #1                                 New York Times                                bestselling and Carnegie Medal-winning author Ruta Sepetys.

That path of memory is rich, yet slippery. There might be patches of black ice or buckled ground…In the universe of memories, we’re all the villain in someone’s story…How might they navigate…the slippery patches of black ice between memory and emotion? Memory. Shifting shapes. Broken mirrors…Memories provide compost for characters…get your heart dirty.”                                      “Certain writers become lighthouses of their genres” and Ruty Sepetys is the lighthouse of hidden history, “a howling pen that writes pure genius.” As you’ll learn throughout this book on story and memory, Sepetys is “a voice of glorious, celebrated fiasco…the things I once perceived as failure were actually sacred instruction on the path to authentic voice. Failure is a compass…Sometimes the glass reflects tears. But more often, it’s fogged by laughter at my own reflection.”                                      Writing is intellectual yoga; when I’m writing my soul exhales.

""They took me in my nightgown."" Who are they… who are you… why would they take you… why couldn't they wait for you to change… how long did you have to be in your nightgown…? That one sentence held so many questions.                                      Every one of Ruta's books hold the same magic, which is why I could not resist reading this one. I do not have plans to become an author, but this book can apply to family history, or just general reading and reviewing of a book. Ruta knows how to build characters and their back-story. She can take a burn hole in an item of clothing and wonder about the story behind it, and then write an amazing novel around that one small detail.                                      This was the same. I loved the details from her poop cocoon, to her mom asking if there was a murder in a house she was checking out, to Ruta eating a whole huge box of 40ish Pepperidge Farm cookies after receiving less than positive feedback on one of her writings. What I was most intrigued to find out was how Ruta first wrote a mystery novel, but then received brilliant advice about her voice lending well to historical fiction. I agree, she is a master in that genre, but now I really want to read her mystery book.

This craft book for writers goes over some of the basics of writing which include such items as plot, character development, and voice. What makes this book stand out has to be Septetys's personal experiences woven throughout. For example, she mentions how important it is to have conflict in your stories and lists the layers. There's also recaps, writing prompts, and stories to uncover.                                      What I loved about this book has to be how Sepetys shares her own personal stories like her mother(who sounds a lot like my own!) Sepetys's love of hearing her own family story-like the one about her Lithuanian family history-led to her amazing historical BETWEEN SHADES OF GRAY. I could relate to this as I also loved hearing my own Italian and Mexican family stories that later found a way into my own writing.

Sepetys encourages writers to use emotional stakes or interesting personality quirks from their own life experience, but to put them in fictional stories.

Sepetys is an expert at the craft, interspersing her own stories with how-tos on how to create emotionally gripping material that paints a scene for the reader.

Filled with factual information about historical events along the way, I’d have to say about half the book is comprised of Charlie’s story, but interspersed between all the nuggets of events and people in Charlie’s time on earth. It is an amazing story that fosters resiliency, determination and bravery. It shows us that we are all human and what we live through makes us who we are. It was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at times.                                      A relatively short read, I’m glad I read it. It was interesting to hear (albeit second hand) what a person thinks and feels that has lived so long. I only hope I get the same opportunity Charlie did.

Dr Charlie White lived a remarkably long life (109 years) and accomplished many things, especially in the medical field. The author, David von Drehle, was his neighbor in later years and heard many of Charlie's stories, which he has compiled in this short biography. Von Drehle likes to think Charlie was a Stoic, a person who can endure pain or hardship without showing their feelings or complaining, because Charlie was able to keep an optimistic outlook on life no matter what befell him. 'The lesson, so simple yet so difficult, is that life can be savored even though it contains hardship, disappointment, loss and even brutality. The choice to see its beauty is available to us at every moment.' Definitely words of wisdom.

This is the tale of Charlie; son, brother, doctor, husband, father, veteran, neighbor, teacher, amongst his many talents.                                      The author didn't intend to write a book about Charlie, his neighbor.                                      His original idea was to write a book for his children (now grown) when they discovered their father wrote for a living.                                      But, instead of a story about pirates and adventure, swashbuckling maidens and cackling minions, the author finds an unlikely tale and friendship in a centenarian when the author and his family relocated to Kansas City.                                      Charlie is that rare breed, not just surpassing the typical lifespan of a man, but his character, his resilience and the adventures and troubles he's endured may have contributed to his longevity.                                      Through the course of their seven year friendship, the author recounts Charlie's life, from his childhood, surviving the sudden death of his father, a renowned pastor, to the freedom and empowerment his mother encouraged in him toward pursuing his life's dreams and the high hopes he had for his future.                                      The author also includes necessary historical context to explain the world in which Charlie grew up in; where children roamed free, where technology was at its most basic, where mob gangs ruled and radios and flight was the most technological innovations at the time; to war and the discovery of penicillin and how doctors at that time are not the same doctors we have now.                                      Is Charlie's longevity due to luck? Yes, partly.                                      But his positive and optimistic outlook on life and career also contributes to his long life; the right combination of genetics, his upbringing, his unique character and personality contributed to the adventures, loss, and world experiences he would endure, survive, and learn from.                                      Readers young and old can learn from Charlie and the author's fruitful friendship with this unique man; to learn and evolve with the times, to let things go, to adapt and be flexible with the changing times and to go with the flow, not against it.","208 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 23, 2023","One of our nation’s most prominent writers finds the truth about how to live a long and happy life in the centenarian next door.

It’s obvious he is a prodigious writer of history. I just received “Triangle: The Fire That Changed America,” also by von Drehle, from my library which is about the fire in a shirtwaist factory in downtown Manhattan, Greenwich Village, in 1911. 146 workers, mostly women, perished in this factory fire, the worst workplace fire prior to 9/11.                                      In “The Book of Charlie,” he fills in so much incredible knowledge which is just hinted at by Charlie, his 109-year-old neighbor in Kansas City, Missouri, who shares with him his life story. In one part, Charlie is talking about his decision to join the army after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He is one of a few doctors in Kansas City and naturally wonders if he will have a practice to return to after the war, if he makes it out alive. He also wonders if he will have his wife, Mildred waiting for him after the war. But he talks about how the war actually propelled the country ahead in technology, engineering, manufacturing, logistics, transportation, communication, and definitely medicine. Von Drehle explains that the discovery of penicillin occurred accidentally in 1928 by Englishman Alexander Fleming. He was working on an experiment to study bacteria and was growing it in Petrie dishes. He was annoyed one day to see a mold was growing in one of the dishes. Upon a second glance, where the mold was growing, there was no bacteria. He put two and two together and voilà, the discovery of penicillin. But this was in 1928. It wasn’t until the beginning of WWII when penicillin was mass produced to try to help all of the soldiers in the army with infections from staph to pneumonia, to blood poisoning.                                      Charlie has wonderful tales to tell from his very early years when he and two friends drive a Model T from Kansas City all the way to Los Angeles in two weeks. There are barely any roads, no maps, obviously no GPS. So most of the ride was planned on the go with directions every now and then like, drive 10 miles on this dirt road until you hit the big oak tree. Then they see someone and are told about 7 miles on this dirt road and then you reach 5 miles of a paved road you turn right onto. It was a very adventurous and interesting tale, especially being used to paved roads and at least maps, and yet they set off with barely anything to guide them all the way west except their young determination. The return home really tested Charlie and sealed his resilience for life. He and one friend made it back in about 4 weeks by hopping railroad cars and picking up odd jobs to get a little money and a place to lay their head and fill their bellies.                                      The other area of medicine which advanced rapidly in 1942 for doctors at war based hospitals was the field of anesthesiology. Charlie carried in his black doctor bag ether and a can to administer it if he needed it on a house call to give stitches, take out tonsils, deliver a baby, or reset some bones, basically all of the things possible for any doctor to do in the 1930’s.                                      But during the war, Charles Lundy of the Mayo Clinic, father of IV anesthesiology, taught Charlie, who was the Chief Doctor at his base, the new ways of anesthesiology. The doctors figured out how to use sodium thiopental through an IV to put people under for surgery. They also learned how to use endothracheal tubes to open airways, support breathing, and to administer the sodium thiopental. All of this paved the way for Charlie to be the first doctor of anesthesiology in Kansas City, and one of the first few in the country in 1946 upon his return from the army.                                      This is the point the author says it most clearly shows Charlie’s resilience and opportunities were self made because even though he entered the army with much trepidation, he remained both realistic and optimistic and again made things happen so he could return from the army and be the head of anesthesiology at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Kansas City.                                      The book of Charlie continues with Charlie still being open to learning and ready for all opportunities as they present themselves. He realized his formal education at the University of Missouri and then his medical school training at Northwestern were just the beginning of a lifetime of learning. This is truly the heart of Charlie’s stories and this book. Because he realized this, he had many more opportunities throughout his life.                                      “Work hard. Spread joy. Take a chance. Enjoy wonder.”These basic nuggets of a long life well lived were at the top of Dr. Charlie White’s stories. He lived up until his 109th birthday and had hundreds of stories showing he lived every single moment of those 109 years.                                      I really enjoyed this book immensely and it touched me deeply. It helped me to realize all I have been blessed with and how I move on and am ready with my eyes wide open to witness the next miracle.                                      Thank you to NetGalley, Simon and Schuster, and the author, David von Drehle for providing me with this advanced reader’s copy of this wonderful tale.

2023-07-03,The Book of Charlie,,David von Drehle,4.21,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Philosophy', 'Biography Memoir']",Kindle $13.99,harry tidwell,Rating 1 out of 5,"May 1, 2023","I received an advanced reader copy of this book from the bookstore I work at. While there were many points in this book where I wanted to quit reading it, I finished it since it is fairly short, less than 200 pages. I took issue with both Charlie's character and Drehle's narration at certain points in this story and will highlight a few of those sections below.                                      Within 20 pages of opening this book Drehle discusses Charlie's partiality towards Confederate ideology, noting how he idolized his grandfather who served as a Confederate in the war. To claim you are writing a book depicting a role model for your kids and then to immediately describe his Confederate beliefs is alarming, to say the least.                                      Next, Drehle spends a portion of the story narrating Charlie's childhood adventures and makes a point to clearly depict how some of Charlie's characteristics or mannerisms illustrate the American Psychological Association's (APA) recipe for 'resilience' under stress. After being sent to a summer boy's camp, Charlie showed signs of being molested or sexually abused by the camp curator. What I disliked about Drehle's narration is that he spent pages speculating about what possibly occurred. To write a sort of memoir or homage to Charlie's memory and then repetitively discuss and speculate about an event that he explicitly did not confide in Drehle felt invasive and served no tangible purpose to the story. YET, if that wasn't disgusting enough, Drehle related this abuse back to the APA's recipe for resilience and essentially claims it helped Charlie in the long run by building character/coping mechanisms. I felt this section of the story was invasive into Charlie's childhood and reflected Drehle's poor attempt at uncovering the childhood of this person.                                      Another concerning characteristic of Charlie is his apparent inclination towards girls significantly younger than him. His first wife was a teenager (her specific age was notably not mentioned) when Charlie was in his mid-twenties. This is a recurring theme throughout his life as his second wife was over a dozen years younger than him, and his third girlfriend was about 25 years younger than him. I absolutely recognize that everyone has different opinions on acceptable age gaps in relationships, but I personally believe such large age gaps can often be predatory and easily manipulative. Both Charlie's narrative and Drehle supported my belief as they often described Charlie's first wife in a very demeaning, passive manner. Although his first wife had mental health struggles and substance abuse issues, both men described the relationship as though Charlie was an independent, responsible man wrapped around the clutches of a volatile, controlling woman. Instead of a heartwarming story about chivarly (which I believe was Drehle's attempt), I feel as though this story contains relationships with alarming maturity and age gaps.                                      Just to briefly mention this diction choice, at one point in the novel Drehle discusses the story of Travis Roy, a young ice hockey player whose career ended when he broke his neck. Just 2 pages later Drehle describes innovation as coming with ""neck-snapping speed."" In what is a very clear reference to the story of Travis Roy just pages earlier, this diction choice came off as incredibly disrespectful to Roy's story. I don't think Roy's tragedy should be used as a metaphor distinctly unrelated themes.                                      Reading is absolutely subjective and while I am glad others have enjoyed this book, I would caution people before picking up this title. Not only does Charlie contain concerning qualities in his character, Drehle's narration and added commentary is sometimes invasive and lacks any substantial reflection into Charlie's life. Almost the entirety of the novel follows the same juvenile format:                                      a. Drehle contextualizes an event                                      b. Drehle narrates one of Charlie's stories during the event mentioned above                                      c. Drehle briefly states on how the story illustrates any semblance of resilience                                      d. Drehe provides a quote or reference to an individual that relates to the event                                      I hope others are able to find a better story where I was not, but I wanted to share my grievance with this story as a warning to others before they jump into it.","208 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 23, 2023","One of our nation’s most prominent writers finds the truth about how to live a long and happy life in the centenarian next door.

Charlie Herbert White was born in 1905, and lived until the ripe age of 109 years. From his youth Charlie adopted a Stoic view on life, and according to the author David Von Drehle who met him through serendipity: “Life can be savored even though it contains hardship, disappointment, loss, and even brutality. The choice to see its beauty is available to us at every moment... Charlie made an art of living. He understood, as great artists do, that every life is a mixture of comedy and tragedy, joy and sorrow, daring and fear.” This isn’t to say that Charlie didn’t have his share of suffering, including in his youth - he lost his father when he was only 8 to a gruesome accident and also came away (emotionally) unscathed from a boys’ camp exploited by sexual predators. As a result, at a young age Charlie donned “an armor of self-reliance” and learned to become “as independent as Huck Finn”. Since then Charlie’s life was nothing short of remarkable, and many of his adventures (e.g., train hopping across the country in his youth, playing saxophone for money on a ship traveling to Asia, joining the AirForce and becoming a chief of anesthetics) are reminiscent of something out of Forrest Gump or The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, except IRL. Even in his 90s Charlie didn’t lose a step and continued to live life to its fullest (homie even courted a gf at that age). Even when he slipped on ice and broke his ankle at age 106 or when he contracted pneumonia at age 107, Charlie escaped the Grim Reaper and thrived on with a positive disposition. Tangentially this book (imo) is also a love story about America through Charlie’s eyes, from the invention of the radio to World War 1 to the Great Depression to World War 2 (he served) to the Cold War and past the invention of the iPhone (which Charlie knew how to use) and 19 (!) U.S. presidents from Teddy Roosevelt to Barack Obama. Whenever asked about his secret to longevity his own answer was simply “luck”, but most likely at least something can be said about how Charlie chose to view this ephemeral experience we call Life - perhaps best summed up in a Viktor Frankl quote: “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way’ of meeting whatever life presents.’”","208 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 23, 2023","One of our nation’s most prominent writers finds the truth about how to live a long and happy life in the centenarian next door.

David von Drehle has written a concise, meaningful profile of his neighbor, Dr. Charles White (Charlie), who was born at the beginning of the 20th century and died in the 21st at the remarkable age of 109 years. During his life as the world completely transformed, Charlie rose above childhood trauma, maintained his equilibrium, remained resilient, and sustained intellectual acuity until the very end of his life. He began practicing medicine when few tools or knowledge for healing existed but learned and grew with rapid scientific advances as his profession was profoundly revolutionized during his exceptionally long career.                                          The history Charlie experienced was fascinating in and of itself, but the true significance of this book is the model he gave for us for our own time. He accepted the inevitable defeats and tragedies of life and then relished the triumphs and joys as they also presented themselves. He did not waste time or energy on negatives he could not change, but instead optimistically sought solutions and new paths forward. He was not a perfect man, but he always remembered and lived by his mother's admonition to ""Do the right thing"" when difficult choices emerged. That                                             sounds                                            simplistic but for Charlie, and everyone else, ""doing the right thing"" can often be inconvenient and profoundly difficult.                                              Charlie White was an ordinary man who lived an extraordinary life for an astondingly long time. He mourned his losses appropriately and then moved forward to enthusiastically meet his future. When asked, he attributed his health and longevity to good fortune, but accepted, as we all must, that his time would run out. He did not obsess with the inevitability of death, one of the most important lessons Charlie has bequeathed us. Rejoice with each hour with no guarantee of the next.                                                  This book was both enjoyable and worthwhile. The author wrote it specifically as a legacy for his children; fortunately he shared it more broadly.","208 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 23, 2023","One of our nation’s most prominent writers finds the truth about how to live a long and happy life in the centenarian next door.

2023-07-03,"Women We Buried, Women We Burned: A Memoir",,Rachel Louise Snyder,4.18,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Feminism', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Womens']",Kindle $9.14,Rosh,Rating 4 out of 5,"June 17, 2023","In a Nutshell:                                      An interesting memoir by a woman who grew up in an extreme evangelical family and made her own way around the world using nothing but her own skills. Not exactly as promised in the blurb, but a decent read nonetheless.                                       Synopsis:                                       When author Rachel Snyder was eight (in 1977), her Jewish mom died of cancer. Her Christian father remarried a Christian divorcee with two kids of her own, and soon opted for an extreme style of evangelical faith and stringent parenting, with corporal punishment being a regular part of his disciplining strategy. Snyder soon became a rebel, being expelled from school, choosing drugs and alcohol, living out of her car, and relying on strangers for her survival. However, her hereditary marketing & communication skills, courtesy her father’s various MLM businesses, ensure that she talks her way to college and later, to travelling across the globe.                                        This memoir focusses on her early life, her escape, her years in Cambodia, and the circumstances behind her return to the US.                                      First, let me set the expectations right.                                      👉 The title, though impactful, is misleading. Somehow, it generalises the topic, giving a feel that the book talks of women who have been attacked by society for various reasons. The book, however, is entirely from a personal point of view, with only a few pages talking of women in general.                                      👉 The blurb also provides a different idea about the content. This line in particular - “ In places like India, Tibet, and Niger, she interviewed those who had been through the unimaginable.” - is probably what she did in real life but it is not a part of the book at all. I admit, the reference to India was one big reason for my requesting this book, and I was disappointed to see that India is mentioned barely a couple of times in passing. The public problem of domestic violence is also not covered to the extent promised. Also, “her distraught father thrust the family into an evangelical, cult-like existence” led me to believe that they had actually joined a cult, which isn’t the case at all. Finally, I avoid memoirs that involve drugs or alcohol or casual sex. (Just a personal reading preference.) The blurb gave no clue about this content, else I wouldn’t have picked this up.                                      Basically, I had opted for this book assuming that it was an expose of the harsh facts related to domestic violence. What I got was a somewhat typical memoir, talking about survival and rebellion and resilience. A major chunk of the book is dedicated to her childhood after mother's death and her younger years after her father's remarriage. It is only after about the 60% mark that she talks about her international experiences, and those too are restricted to her years and personal experiences in Cambodia with no clue about how she earned her living there.                                      This is not to take away from her story. If anyone writes a memoir, it goes without saying that they have something to share, and this author has a lot to share indeed. Her childhood years under her domineering father were horrendous, and it must have taken a lot of courage to explore those old wounds again and pen them down. When she writes, “I lost my mother to cancer and my father to religion”, your heart actually breaks for her. The elements set in Cambodia were very interesting, and I could see glimpses of her journalistic prowess.                                      But as this is a book review, I am rating and reviewing the book and not the person. And the book, specifically the writing style, generated mixed feelings in me.                                      The narration of many events seems as ad hoc as Snyder’s job choices, seemingly going from random point to random point without any flow. Many important elements of her life, such as her decision of opting for journalism or her divorce, are brushed aside hastily. There are time jumps without warning, and while we can fill in some of the blanks, many facts stay hidden even until the end. I wish the book would have plugged in these gaps so that we readers got to experience a fluid narrative than one coming in spurts.                                      The ending is what disappointed me the most. The book goes a whole circle as Snyder returns to her father and her stepmom due to certain personal situations. Until that point, we hear nothing positive about her parents, but after her return, all we see is her sympathy and acceptance of her stepmom without any mention of what provoked this abrupt change of heart. The decision of forgiveness and acceptance seems to come out of nowhere. Another sore point for me is that I am not sure of how the stepmom, who was a reserved woman, would have felt [were she alive] about some of her intimate details being revealed in a public work.                                       🎧 The Audiobook Experience:                                      The audiobook, clocking at 9 hrs 48 minutes, is read by the author herself. I am not usually a fan of authors reading their own works, but in this case, the author does a great job. If the content interests you, the audiobook is a great way of experiencing this memoir.                                      All in all, this is an interesting memoir focussing on one woman’s tough life and her determination to make it in the world. Don’t pick it up expecting a greater focus on domestic violence or a spotlight on the other countries mentioned in the blurb. It shares a journey of personal growth than of social activism.                                      3.5 stars, rounding up for the audio version.

Although Rachel Louise Snyder has written several books, this was the first book I have read by her. How fitting that I picked her own memoir to read as my first book by her. In Women We Buried, Women We Burned, Rachel Louise Snyder, gingerly exposed her life to her readers. She led her readers down the many paths she followed over the course of her life. Rachel Louise Snyder learned the meaning of grief at the tender age of eight when her mother died from breast cancer. Her and her brother’s lives were then guided solely by her Evangelical father and its movement. From the moment her father chose to embrace the teachings of the Evangelical Church, Rachel’s childhood was shrouded entirely by his faith and his blind and unbidden acceptance of their beliefs. Women We Buried, Women We Burned was the author’s own personal journey through her life from childhood, her rebellious teenage age years, college, graduate school, young adulthood, marriage, motherhood and beyond. It was well written but sometimes difficult to read. Rachel Louise Snyder was such a brave, courageous and honest woman who was determined to thrive despite the life she was made to endure. She would eventually learn how to overcome her struggles, demons, insecurities, fears and the influences of the cruel and dangerous world she was made to live in. It was not an easy feat.                                      In 1979, only a few months after her mother’s death, Rachel and her brother were brought to Illinois by their father. They had been invited to attend a family camp or revival meeting by their Aunt Janet and Uncle Jim who were leaders in the Evangelical Church. It was the early days of the Evangelical movement. Rachel’s father bought into all that it stood for. Overnight, he became a religious fanatic. He also felt that the church offered him the chance to start his life over. After all, he was only thirty-nine years old when he found himself a widower. At that revival meeting, Rachel’s father met Barbara. She was a divorced woman, a high school dropout and mother of two children. Strangely enough, the death of Rachel’s mother was never discussed or brought up by anyone anymore. It was as if she had never existed. None of that prepared Rachel or her brother for when their father told them that he was marrying Barbara and that they should call her “mom”. They soon became a blended family and Rachel began to live in a state of fear, uncertainty and despair. Rachel questioned her father’s choices. It was as if he was a stranger to her. He had transformed before her very eyes.                                      “I’ll never know why my father took the wild detour he took. I asked. A million times I asked, in ways both covert and direct. In whispers and in screams. In violence and submission. I asked for years. And others asked me, so many others. Friends I would meet throughout my life, and my relatives In Pittsburgh and Boston, and people who’d known my real mother, or only later heard her story. They all asked. And I kept asking. The whiplash of what came next, after that revival. I only ever got one answer: because God told us to. Even today, with all that I know and all that I’ve lived, I still can’t answer.                                      David and I moved to Illinois two weeks after family camp. Cancer took my mother. But religion would take my life.”                                      Women We Buried, Women We Burned must have been extremely difficult for Rachel Louise Snyder to articulate, remember and write. I can’t imagine all the pain, hurt, disappointment and grief she experienced throughout her life. She was lucky to have met such wonderful friends along her journey through life. I admire her for her strength, courage and commitment to overcome the toxicity that consumed her earlier years in life. Women We Buried, Women We Burned was Rachel’s story about Rachel’s transformation and her own self discoveries she made about herself. Through all the hurt, ridicule and suffering she underwent, Rachel came out as a stronger, more independent, intelligent and honest woman. Women We Buried, Women We Burned touched on the themes of family, religion, illness, violence, motherhood, grief and loss. I highly recommend this memoir.

It’s a memoir. It’s heart wrenching, and leaves me in amazement at the author’s strength through so many devastating losses. This story gives us a glimpse into the hardships and devastation of loosing a mother young, the consequences of a father’s instability, the damages of fundamentalism in an already broken family, and the courage to rise up from those ashes. I feel inspired by her story to continue to fight to overcome my own family’s dysfunctions, and all that fundamentalism has stolen from my own life.

I was left in awe of the author's strength, determination, grace and poise throughout her life as she shared with us some of her deepest, darkest experiences and feelings.                                      This is truly a story of resilience and thriving against all odds. Snyder had me feel grief, despair, anger, fear, determination, joy, pride, and peace along with her. So many times I wanted to reach out and hug her and I found myself cheering for her all along the way. So many people would have used her early life experiences as an excuse to quit but she used them to propel her forward and I have so much respect and admiration for her.

It’s hard to say that I loved a book on such a depressing subject, but I did. It blew me away. So as soon as I saw that she had a new book��and a memoir, no less! My favorite genre!–I knew I had to read it immediately. And then I saw it was also about domestic violence and I was both astonished but also now her previous book made so much sense.                                      But the violence in her house did not. It truly didn’t. Even more so than the usual horrible story about abuse. Rachel’s mother died when she was pretty young, from cancer. Her father quickly remarried, to an evangelical Christian (they’d been raised Jewish up until that point) and moved the family away from their support and extended family. And after the remarriage, that’s when the abuse began. Rachel theorizes that the overused pseudo-Christian phrase, “Spare the rod, spoil the child�� had to do with that non-coincidence. (Everyone thinks that phrase is from the bible and it isn’t.) Rachel rebels. Very strongly. In ways that would terrify me, even as I cheered her on. She parties a lot and does a lot of drugs. She drops out of high school, and starts booking gigs for a band. She has a difficult time finding housing (which makes sense as she was under 18.) She starts to work her butt off, and eventually an older man she’s involved with gets her to take her GED and he knows someone at a local college who will talk to her… and he gets her into college. With no high school transcript to speak of.                                      I knew she became a successful journalist, but there were large swaths of this book, where I just could not see how she got from Point A to Point B. There just didn’t seem like a path in between. And yet she did it. She even lived outside of the country for years.                                      And when she moved back, her step-mother was sick. And Rachel, oddly, became her caretaker (she had four biological children who did assist somewhat, but not like Rachel.) At the end, to my astonishment, she forgave her parents, and even admitted she loved her step-mother. This journey to hell and back took my breath away. Half of what she went through and accomplished in her life would be impressive. The forgiveness was the most impressive part of it. I’m still not sure I understand how she got there, even after weeks of mulling over the book. She could teach me some lessons, that’s for sure. I hope she keeps writing and writing. I will now read anything she writes. I even want to go back and look up her earlier books. She’s a favorite author of mine. And that’s a very, very hard list to get onto.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 23, 2023","For decades, Rachel Louise Snyder has been a fierce advocate reporting on the darkest social issues that impact women's lives.

But religion would take my life.                                      (loc. 379)                                      When she was a child, Snyder's life took an abrupt turn: her mother died, her father remarried, and Snyder was expected to switch from low-key Judaism to fervent conservative Christianity. It...did not go well. Years later, her life took another abrupt turn: she left the country for the first time and experienced cultures other than her own. (That went rather better.)                                      From the description, I thought I might be getting something along the lines of Putsata Reang's                                       Ma and Me                                      , although that might just have been the bits about Cambodia and travelling the globe. But in a lot of ways this is a fit for readers who loved                                       Educated                                      —harsh applications of religion, growing up much too young and also being spit out into the broader world with little understanding of how things worked, variations on violence. (I'll note that you can't go wrong with any of these three books, though you might draw different connections between them than I do.)                                      There is                                       so much                                      in here. Snyder tells a mostly linear story, and I think too much getting into the details here would detract from the reading experience, but I'll just say that she has the writing chops to tell her story well and to ultimately portray the complicated people in her life in all their, well, complicated glory. At one point there's a significant time jump, and it makes a lot of sense for the story, but it also means that I'm probably going to have to hunt up some of Snyder's shorter-form writing, because it sounds like her curiosity about the world has led her to story upon story upon story that could use books of their own.                                      This was not quite the book I was expecting, and it was better for it—because I never quite knew where the next chapter would take me, but I trusted that it would be somewhere interesting.

I was fortunate to listen to the audiobook, and the author's narration of her own story, of course, adds another layer of personalization and vulnerability. I strongly recommend this version when and where accessible.                                      Snyder takes readers on a challenging and authentic feeling journey through her traumas and triumphs, beginning with her mother's death from breast cancer when Snyder was a young girl. As any reader can imagine, the loss of her mother haunts Snyder throughout her life, and this was one of my favorite running themes: her frequent consideration of how things might have been different in certain situations, how her mother might have prepared her, and especially the ways in which she finds an element of closure.                                      In addition to her mother's death, Snyder experiences many other traumas that readers sensitive to information on child abuse, sexual assault, and rape should be particularly attuned to in advance of their reading or listening journeys.                                      Snyder takes readers through her past, through multiple countries, and through lives and deaths, all in an effort to come full circle, which she accomplishes expertly. Fans of memoirs should definitely queue this one (after reviewing all related TWs and CWs).                                      *Special thanks to NetGalley and HighBridge Audio for this alc, which I received in exchange for an honest review.

It was a beautiful story of a child just trying to survive. Rachel was able to accomplish a lot from where she came. She is a true survivor who refused to be a victim. I would like to say I am proud of her. People who have suffered are those who have to most empathy for others. People who try to make the world a better place so others do not have to go through what they did. Very inspiring story. I love reading books like this.

Raised in a fundamentalist Christian household after the death of her Jewish mother, Rachel struggles to thrive under the thumb of relentless patriarchy and religion. A runaway and a high-school dropout, we follow Rachel through the darkest of days to the point where someone decides to take a chance on her and she enrolls in college on academic probation. The second half of the book follows her life abroad, first as a student on semester at sea, then as a correspondent, journalist and expat, ending with her reconnection with her stepmother, who is dying from cancer. I would have liked to hear more about her time abroad and journalistic work, and I think there was space here for more acknowledgement of the white privilege that surely was at play in pulling her out of the trajectory her life was in as a teenager. However, this was still an eye-opening and impactful memoir.                                      4.5 stars, rounded up for Goodreads.

Endowed of remarkable resilience and empowered by ever-improving survival skills, Rachel wanders through her adolescence and experiences sex, drugs, and rock’n’roll until she finds herself in college, where she gets by, thanks to her superior intelligence and a little help from her friends.  To her surprise, she discovers a love of learning, fascination with history, and, most importantly, commonality with other women – battered and buried women, who have survived or who have been defeated. Then she binds herself to an abiding faith that she can make a difference.                                      Ultimately, Rachel Louise Snyder’s story is one of evolving maternalism.

The book focuses largely on her youth, as she struggled to cope with her grief and anger following the loss of her mother, and rebelled against the abuse and control of her evangelical father and stepmother. After a few aimless young adult years, Snyder finds her way in college, ultimately landing as a journalist living abroad in Cambodia. Her time there sounds like it would make for an interesting book of its own. Her reflections on family, loss, and motherhood come full circle as Snyder returns home, with a child of her own, at the end of the book to care for her dying stepmother. Snyder writes clearly and candidly, and tells a powerful story of healing and redemption.                                      Overall, this was a good read. Some sections felt a bit uneven in their coverage and slow at times, but Snyder tells a complete story that comes together well.

Compelling, heartbreaking, wrenching, gripping, propulsive, and disturbing.                                      An impressive bio, Snyder is an award-winning global journalist. She has traveled to sixty countries over the past two decades, covering human rights, gender-based violence, natural disasters, displacement, and war stories.                                       Hauntingly beautiful,                                      told with compassion and insight, written with stunning lyrical prose, the author shares her story, an intimate, raw, honest account of her childhood to adulthood.                                      A coming-of-age narrative of grief, domestic abuse, neglect, betrayal, religion, and the cult-like environment—overcoming tragedy to hope.                                       A story of a young woman against all odds.                                      Heartwrenching to lose her mother at the very young age of 8; she has no role models. Raised by a father obsessed with a strict Evangelical religion-like cult environment (violence, control), nonsupportive, and then a stepfamily. Her dad loses all the money her mom left her. She is lost. He is driving her away to live on her own, alone. All the adults have failed her.                                      She grew up learning there was nothing but danger and darkness in the world, made to be fearful. This is quite true and common as children are raised in religious environments, instilling fear, thinking this will make the child stay on the straight and narrow.                                      ""And once I got out into that world, I didn't find that to be true at all. It was my first real lesson in how wrong the worldview of my parents was because it was informed by their own ignorance.""                                      At 16, her father and stepmother informed Snyder, her older brother, and her two older stepsiblings that they were no longer welcome in their suburban Chicago home. During the 1890s, she and her siblings were forced to submit to a strict evangelical upbringing with pain and physical punishment.                                      ""Cancer took my mother, but religion took my life.""                                      She had already been expelled from the high school she had barely attended, obtaining a G.P.A. of 0.467. From numerous jobs, being a troubled teen, drugs, and having to leave school to support herself and survive. She lived out of her car for the next year and a half, sleeping on couches and floors.                                      She eventually attained her G.E.D. and went to college and graduate school; a generous uncle helped her spend a semester at sea, where she explored an entirely new world and outlook, more prominent than the strict confines of her childhood.                                      For six years, she was a journalist based in Cambodia. She fell in love and had a daughter while living abroad, finding support from friends.                                       Tenacious and courageous,                                      she gets her education and makes her mark in the world, climbing her way out of the past, traveling the world, motherhood, to a globally recognized journalist                                      She is a survivor and will fight against all obstacles. She possessed great reliance and strength with heart and forgiveness for those who failed her. Decades later, summoned by her father, her stepmother is dying from colon cancer, and she goes to her side, caring for her, which is quite emotional.                                      Ultimately, she invites us into a brave and loving space of forgiveness. A memoir of courage and self-invention. A story she carried for more than four decades.                                      You will be touched and moved, thinking of the memoir long after it ends. Powerful. Moving. Unforgettable. Astounding. Superb! Thank you for sharing.

Eight-year-old Rachel and her older brother, David, return from school to find an ambulance parked in front of their house. This, in and of itself, is not a remarkable occurrence; their mother, Gail, has been ill for nearly as long as Rachel can remember. This time, however, the ambulance is parked outside. Inside, Rachel’s mother --- accompanied by Rachel’s grandmother and aunt --- struggles to breathe, eventually drawing her last desperate breath as her daughter looks on.                                      This is traumatic in several ways, but it also sets the stage for everything that follows in Rachel’s account of growing up without her mother, growing apart from her father, and trying to reclaim what it means to be a daughter and a mother. As Rachel recounts, her father, a Christian, swore that Gail called on Jesus during her final moments, even though he wasn’t even there to witness her death. This rewriting of history accomplishes several things: it robs Gail of her Jewish identity, it calls into question Rachel’s own eyewitness recollections of that day, and it centers her father’s perspective on the whole incident. In short, it erases essential facets of both Rachel and her mother from the scene.                                      This erasure is recapitulated throughout Rachel’s childhood and adolescence. Remarrying quickly, her father embraces evangelical Christianity, refusing to acknowledge his children’s Jewish heritage or even talk about his late wife. His version of Christianity goes hand-in-hand with patriarchal authority and harsh, borderline abusive discipline. It results in Rachel, David and their two older step-siblings getting kicked out of the family home as teenagers.                                      Rachel describes her adolescence as a series of failures and near-disasters, precipitated in many cases by a lack of adult guidance and her own lingering anger. It’s only when she gains experience managing a friend’s band --- a fun job that leads her in a roundabout way to college --- that she starts to glimpse a different path for herself, one that eventually leads around the world before returning her back to her family.                                      Rachel tells her story straightforwardly, with a minimum of blame and self-pity. Her background as a journalist shines through as she describes her experiences honestly but without added drama or artifice, instead letting the people and events speak for themselves. This results in a narrative whose style belies its depth, for even as Rachel recounts her own maturation as a woman and a writer, she’s also commenting obliquely on how trauma is recapitulated and the countless ways in which male authority warps and erases women’s stories and lived realities. How she undertakes this work is subtle, even crafty.                                      WOMEN WE BURIED, WOMEN WE BURNED can be read on several different levels and likely will land differently with every reader. As a result, it will lead to rereadings and rich discussions.

Book opens with an ambulance at young author Rachel’s home. Her mom who has been in and out of the hospital for for Rachel’s with cancer& had been announced in remission 2 wks prior but couldn’t breathe and died.                                      She was Raised in evangelical home, and her dad remarried Barb with 2 kids and they have two more so 6 in total. He physically abused the kids (“spare the rod, spoil the child”) and Rachel rebels with drinking, drugs, sex etc. Dad kicks the four oldest out and R survives, just, sleeping out of her car and supporting herself. She starts to manage a rock band. Eventually, she gets her act together, gets her GED, and goes to college including a semester at Sea, which changes her life. Around the same time, she discovers writing. She lives for six years in Cambodia, where she meets her husband.                                      The book is, as I suppose similar to life, full of contradictions. As is her prerogative, she portrays herself in the best possible light; it would be interesting to hear her dad’s perspective. I am not excusing his behavior in any way, but she is very forgiving (they did the best they could), and then kind of turns on him (they were the parents, and I was the kid and it was their obligation to take care of me). I just wonder what the real story is. She reconciles at the end with her stepmom who dies of cancer, even calling her Mom (which she refused to do as a teen). She disses religion and the US but winds up returning to Judaism and living in DC. She lived in her car as a teen and is then reluctant to sleep in a Tokyo train station with a classmate? The divorce to her husband is just relayed out of the blue in a sentence. I was like, wait, what? What happened?                                      Author is obviously bright as evidenced by her ability to live on her own and become band manager and taught herself the business. She’s a beautiful writer, and I’m glad she found this more productive outlet. The world is better for it.                                      -My mother seemed old to me. 35. It was only the years still to come that brought her youth into sharp focus, as I myself aged toward that number.

I was captivated by this book title, and by the initial synopsis, however, what I was promised wasn't what I got. The title made me think it would be more focused on the women she encountered, and the ways their lives were impacted by the women around them, but mostly it was just a first hand account of her life to that point. There was very little talk of the evangelist cult times, and it focused much more on the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father, and (peripherally) the schemes and MLM scams that are so prevalent in the ultra-religious sects.                                      Quotes, such as, ""Cancer took my mother. But religion would take my life."" really don't fit. Religion may have made her separate from her family (though really never for long or in any sort of permanent way), but by all accounts in this book, she has done more living before 40 than many folks do their entire lives. It all seemed very dramatized as the book progressed, without too many facts or actual events to back statements like these up.                                      The author spends much more time speaking about the men in her life, and how they either helped or hurt her as she progressed through life on her own.                                      Her interviews later in her career, or even how she made a jump to that career (or really even what her career actually is, as I am unfamiliar with her beyond this title), is nowhere to be found in the book.                                      All in all, it's a pretty basic memoir, though it felt stripped of all the things that would really make it an intriguing one. I was left with so many more questions than answers, and can't say I feel the time spent with this title has really been well used.                                      I will say that the audiobook was produced well, and I appreciate that the author read it herself - that gave it a little more credit than I would have had someone else been the narrator.                                      All in all, I'm not sure I'd recommend this one. That's always hard for me to say with a memoir, but please understand that I'm critiquing the book here, not the human behind the book.

At the beginning of the book she claims, “Cancer took my mother, but religion would take my life.” This is a powerful statement that reflects her father’s strict evangelical beliefs and parenting style. She is expelled from school and kicked out of her house by 16, though she is able to make an amazing turn around and live a successful life as a journalist living abroad.                                      Snyder has an interesting life, from being a troubled teen to being a booker for heavy metal bands to studying and traveling abroad. She faced many traumatic experiences that are told in a very matter-of-fact way. She isn’t overly emotional, though she does reflect on the ways in which her father let her down and how becoming a parent revealed to her just how inexcusable her father’s actions were. I liked the first half of the book, but it faltered for me in the second half. I was most compelled by her youth. She was a troubled teen who saw no future or hope for herself, yet she was able to go from being a high school expellee to traveling the world as a journalist. That struggle and transition was glazed over. In one chapter she’s couch surfing anywhere she can, then the next she has her GED, then she’s in college studying abroad, then she’s a journalist. It felt very disjointed, and the summary of the book didn’t match my expectations. The book doesn’t really touch on her journalism at all, focusing instead on her time abroad where she got married and had a child before moving back to the United States. She does discuss some of what she was investigating at the time, but not nearly as much as the summary would lead you to believe. I always appreciate hearing the author read their own memoirs, and I enjoyed the narration. The second half of the story wasn’t particularly interesting to me, though I do think she has a life story others would find worth reading.

I didn't know if it would have been a book that I would have been interested in, yet I was proven wrong almost immediately. What an empowering story. Unlike many others that have read this book, I really knew nothing about Rachel Snyder. I didn't know the genre that was typical for her, let alone anything about her personal life. Immediately, I was drawn. Her resiliency throughout the book was astonishing.                                      From losing her mother at a very young age, to being uprooted by her father shortly after, Rachel continued to persevere. Not only was she moved from her family home, her father remarried and brought the family into a ""born-again Christianity"" cult like experience that provided a whiplash of sorts to Rachel and her siblings, especially since they were raised as Jewish. Rachel rebelled, causing her to leave home, drop out of high school, get into partying and drugs, etc. Despite all the challenges, she continued to move forward. She formed relationships with others that helped her move in a positive and constructive direction. She received her GED and made it to college. She had gotten married and had a child of her own. She traveled the world. I think the part I most admired was that she came back to support the family that did not show the same support to her. She became a fierce advocate for her dying step mother to ensure she lived her last days with dignity and respect.                                      I will 1000% read other books by this author.

This is the memoir of Rachel Louise Snyder, a journalist, writer, and professor who covers difficult topics such as domestic violence and human rights violations. She has spent much of her life living abroad and has worked as an international correspondent.                                      This is a very difficult book to review. The blurb of this book makes it appear as if this book will be approximately 50% her upbringing and 50% her life as an international correspondent, though this is not the case. The first 70% of this memoir takes place in the United States. Snyder's international work is what drew me into this memoir, but Snyder's writing and story was so engrossing that I was not upset by this. However, I almost think Snyder could have written two memoirs, one of her youth and one of her life as a correspondent.                                      This memoir, sadly, has numerous content warnings. Snyder tells her life story exactly as it was, including the horrible details such as sexual assault, physical abuse, and child homelessness. Snyder does not include any unnecessary details, and she writes these topics well. This book starts almost immediately with parental death, and as someone who lost a parent at a young age, this was the hardest part to listen to but I also felt comforted in hearing my own experience read to me.                                      Snyder's voice - both written and verbal - is mesmerizing and heartfelt. I truly felt for this girl (now woman) that had to grow up in such difficult situations, and Snyder does a great job of examining her past as she tells it.

Is it because he hasn’t won a Tony, or found a husband, or had a child? And what if he doesn’t want those things? (A husband and a child, that is. He wants a Tony.)                              In essays drawn from his life and career, Rannells argues that we all pretend we are constantly winning. And with each success, we act like we’ve reached the pinnacle of happiness (for our parents), maturity (for our friends), success (for our bosses), and devotion (for our partners). But if “adulting” is just a pantomime that’s leaving us unmoored, then we need new markers of time, new milestones, new expectations of what adulthood is–and can be.                              Along the way, Rannells looks back, reevaluating whether his triumphs were actually failures–and his failures, triumphs–and exploring what it will take to ever, ever feel like he has enough. In essays like “Uncle of the Year,” he explores the role that children play in his life, as a man who never thought having kids was necessary or even possible—until his siblings have kids and he falls in love with a man with two of his own. “It’s an Honor to Be Eligible” reveals the thrills and absurdities of the awards circuit (and the desire to be recognized for your work). And in “Horses, Not Zebras,” he shares the piece of wisdom that helped him finally come to terms with crippling anxiety and perfectionism.                              Filled with witty and honest insights and observations, and a sharp sense of humor,                               Uncle of the Year                              challenges us to take a long look at who we're pretending to be, who we know we are, and who we want to become."

His voice and his stories are so funny. His first didn’t cover the period of his career after he got to debut on Broadway, so this one finally talks about                                       Hairspray                                      ,                                       The Book of Mormon                                      , and more.

Well, lucky for us, the pandemic gave the actor plenty of down time, and he's now graced us with that coveted sequel.                                      It basically picks up where we left off, though Rannells eschews a strict chronological telling of his story (which a few times gest a mite confusing - he's a huge success in Mormon, and then we backtrack to when he was a chorus boy) in favor of thematic coherence. Thus, we get chapters on auditioning, on awards shows, on therapy, on being on Cameo during the pandemic, on being an uncle and stepdad, etc.                                      These are all amusing and fun, with a few pithy and trenchant observations thrown in for good measure. As in that first book, the things NOT mentioned are sometimes seemingly more interesting than what's included: we get the back story of Andy taking a meeting with uber-producer Ryan Murphy and pitching himself as the lead for what would become his failed gay family sit-com, 'The New Normal' - but not a word on the actual production of the show itself. One brief anecdote on working on the film version of 'The Prom' - but I'm sure there was much more to tell. His Broadway shows 'Falsettos' and the revival of 'Boys in the Band' also get short shrift, as does his London stint in 'Tammy Faye'. But we do get a hilarious chapter going into great detail on the six weeks he played the male lead in 'Miss Saigon' in upstate New York - something I think only his most rabid fans would even know about.                                      And also rather oddly, he's been in a relationship with fellow actor Tuc Watkins for over five years - who makes only a very brief cameo in the final chapter. We do, however, get some lovely gossipy tales about various other famous folk - Mark Ruffalo, Lena Dunham and Hugh Jackman all come in for some huzzahs; Aaron Tveit and Sienna Miller for some boos!                                      So ultimately, let's just hope Rannells continues to give us more of the same in a third volume - but perhaps be a little more personally forthcoming next time!","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","Candid, hilarious essays from the star of                                 The Book of Mormon, Girls,                                and                                 Big Mouth                                on anxiety, ambition, and the uncertain path to adulthood, which ask, how will we know when we get there?

My only frustration with Mr. Rannells' first book is that it stopped on the cusp of his Broadway success. Now I have no criticism at all.                                      Well, I guess I should mention that this is an essay collection, not a memoir. Various essays talk about, say, auditioning or taking meetings in Hollywood or attending awards shows, and within the context of those essays we learn quite a bit about his career. Other essays focus more on his personal life, such as the title essay and other pieces that focus on family and friends.                                      As is often the case, I listened to the audiobook, which Mr. Rannells' reads. This was an absolute pleasure! Firstly, no one is better at telling a life story than the author, especially if the author is a gifted actor. Also, much of this book is hilarious, and literally no one could milk this material for more laughs.                                      These are mostly light stories, but occasionally the material is a bit darker and more introspective, such as the time he had a drunken indiscretion with a very religious, deeply closeted, and married cast member. Obviously, this is not a happy story, and is not something he is proud of. And it is these occasional admissions that give the collection just enough heft to become substantive. I mean, it's nice to know that Hugh Jackman is always ready with a well-timed hug (And didn't you already know that intuitively?), but by the end, there is the feeling that Mr. Rannells has shared a bit of himself. And even in the entertaining but fluffy segments, there is still a feeling of genuine candor throughout.                                      I don't know how many of these collections Mr. Rannells has in him, but I will definitely be reading them as long as he is writing them!","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","Candid, hilarious essays from the star of                                 The Book of Mormon, Girls,                                and                                 Big Mouth                                on anxiety, ambition, and the uncertain path to adulthood, which ask, how will we know when we get there?

Uncle of the Year: & Other Debatable Triumphs                                      is stage, screen, and voice actor Andrew Rannells’ second memoir. I feel the need to preface my review of this book with an admission that before reading it, I knew very little of his personal life and personality. I hadn’t picked up his first memoir, which covers his childhood and the years leading up to his Broadway debut. I don’t believe I’ve read or watched any of his promotional interviews. But I did catch him in                                       The Book of Mormon                                      many years ago and I’ve seen some of his screen performances since then, so I knew he was a talented and successful actor. And I love a good celebrity memoir, so I gave this a try.                                      I am happy to report that                                       Uncle of the Year                                      is pretty delightful. There are some celebrity memoirs that read like a laundry list of events and achievements or barely organized pages of name-dropping and laundry-airing. Rannells’ book is neither of those things. (Though there are some nice mentions of Paul Rudd, Mark Ruffalo, and Hugh Jackman. Some of his theater colleagues and                                       Girls                                      co-stars also get shout-outs. And I learned his best friend is Zuzanna Szadkowski, arguably the best part of                                       Gossip Girl                                      . Dorota!)                                      In a series of essays that are often witty and sometimes introspective, Rannells reflects on his life and what he thinks the markers of his adulthood have been. The themes of his anecdotes include, but are not limited to, the highs and lows of being in show business, dealing with anxiety and therapy, the messiness of dating and relationships, and—of course—being an uncle or grown-up-type figure. His tone is conversational and candid, and I genuinely laughed out loud many times throughout the memoir.                                      I would definitely recommend                                       Uncle of the Year                                      if you’re looking for a well-written, entertaining read that successfully balances humor and self-reflection.

I was expecting more of a biography and not a collection of essays about his life. The book is very readable but covers things experiences from his life like auditioning for Book of Mormon, being nominated and performing at the Tony’s and taking meetings in Hollywood. He writes with familiarity making it sound like a conversation as shares his experiences. The book isn’t written chronologically, and the chapters or essays are topically driven. I love theater and have seen most of the shows he mentions playing in or auditioning for although I’ve never seen him. I wasn’t aware until writing this review that he has a previously published memoir.

But if “adulting” is just a pantomime that’s leaving us unmoored, then we need new markers of time, new milestones, new expectations of what adulthood is–and can be.                              Along the way, Rannells looks back, reevaluating whether his triumphs were actually failures–and his failures, triumphs–and exploring what it will take to ever, ever feel like he has enough. In essays like “Uncle of the Year,” he explores the role that children play in his life, as a man who never thought having kids was necessary or even possible—until his siblings have kids and he falls in love with a man with two of his own. “It’s an Honor to Be Eligible” reveals the thrills and absurdities of the awards circuit (and the desire to be recognized for your work). And in “Horses, Not Zebras,” he shares the piece of wisdom that helped him finally come to terms with crippling anxiety and perfectionism.

Most people might know Andrew Rannells from his starring role in a                                       little                                      broadway show called                                       The Book of Mormon                                      . (Or when he temporarily played King George III in                                       Hamilton                                      .) I was first introduced to Rannells when he played on the hit HBO show                                       Girls                                      . He was one of my favorite characters, despite originally only having a smaller part. In                                       Uncle of the Year                                      , a collection of short essays, Rannells’ shares snippets from his life, covering subjects from how he feels about his birthday to performing his solo song from                                       Mormon                                      on the Tonys to how strange life got during the pandemic. And, of course, how he feels about being an uncle. Witty and charming, this collection kept drawing me back, oddly comforting when I needed an escape from reality.                                      Despite reading this in ebook form, I could “hear” Rannells’ distinctive voice throughout the pages. I can only imagine the audiobook form of this collection read from Rannells’ own lips would be even better.                                       Uncle of the Year                                      is Rannells second book. From what I understand, his first book                                       Too Much is Not Enough                                      is more of a traditional memoir, covering his childhood up to being cast in                                       The Book of Mormon                                      . It’s not one I have read yet. So maybe                                       Uncle of the Year                                      picks up where that one left off, although he does include events from that time period, as well, in                                       Uncle of the Year                                      . He also includes a story he left out of his first book about appearing on the Ricki Lake show when he was 18, which was quite memorable.                                      Some of my other favorite essays in the book:                                      “Saigon in the Finger Lakes” – Rannells shares his experience performing the lead male role in Miss Saigon over five weeks in the Finger Lakes region of New York by sharing his email correspondence with his best friend during the time. I smiled so much throughout this chapter. Only with our best friends can we be so frank and comfortable.                                      “Happy Birthday” – He discusses his complicated relationship with his birthday: his favorite birthday when he was five, the birthdays that slipped quietly by when he was working, and how he spent his last birthday sitting at the oncologist with his mother. I think I identified with this chapter because I’ve always had similar feelings about my own birthday. Rannells concludes that because his birthday always fell during the first week of school when he was a child, he never got to really celebrate it the way other kids did, which had me thinking about my own birthday which falls very near Valentine’s Day and how my experience was somewhat similar. Maybe there’s something to his theory?                                      “What Words Can I Give You That Will Comfort Me?” – During the pandemic, Rannells decided to join the Cameo app to raise money for the Actors Fund. Cameo allowed fans of public figures to reach out directly and request a short video for a fee. Many people requested birthday or anniversary wishes, but Rannells was surprised and understandably nervous about some of the requests, which varied from words of comfort to bordering on therapy sessions by repeat clients. I remember hearing about Cameo during the pandemic, but I never used it. It was intriguing to get a glimpse into the experience from the perspective of a celebrity who was also struggling through the pandemic.                                      If you’re a fan of Andrew Rannells or                                       The Book of Mormon                                      or actors’ experiences behind the scenes—or even if you’re an adult who has no desire for their own children—you’ll enjoy                                       Uncle of the Year                                      .

I gained insight into his life and the struggles that he has been through. I also have a very strong desire to go watch him on Broadway right this minute. I had seen him in the show Girls on HBO, but I have never seen him perform in musical theater. Before I started this book I knew very little about him. After reading this book I feel connected and would love to watch more of the productions he is in. I also would like to read his first memoir.                                      The book starts out with an introspective on when he felt he became an adult. I found out that we are exactly the same age born only one month apart, so I could relate with so many of the different cultural aspects he discussed. Many times during this book I laughed out loud at the different stories he told. My absolute favorite though was his time at the Auburn theater in the Finger Lakes. I am also from the Finger Lakes and my sister-in-law is from Auburn. I could not stop laughing as he described the region and the people he met. Rannells also discussed the pandemic and his personal experience trying to navigate this difficult time. He was very open about his struggles. This was very refreshing as this was such a difficult time for so many of us. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to read a fresh and witty memoir. Even if you don't know much about him, I think you will enjoy this. This book even gave me a little perspective on my own life.

I've been a longtime fan of Andrew Rannells, ever since I first listened to the Book of Mormon soundtrack in 2015. I read his other memoir, ""Too Much Is Not Enough"", and loved it, and I'm happy to report that ""Uncle of the Year"" hit the spot as well! Equal parts hilarious and emotionally reflective, Rannells lays it all out on the line once again in a variety of heartfelt and touching essays that never lack his signature flair. As a giant musical theatre fan I of course loved the Broadway centric chapters, but his more personal entries, like the one on his experience with Therapy, hit just as hard.

With this release, Rannells proves yet again that he can really do it all. Not only is he a talented actor and singer on both stage and screen, but he is also a hilarious writer whose essays had me grinning from ear to ear. For those who read his first book, Too Much Is Not Enough, and ended the book wanting more, his second release, Uncle of the Year, is the answer to your prayers. While the first book ended with his first role on Broadway, this book explores what happened after he became famous, as well as some pre-frame stories previously not explored. This collection is a brilliant series of interconnected essays that had me laughing and smiling all the way through. Rannells pulls no punches and gets candid in a way rarely seen from a star who has yet to reach the zenith of their career. With the right mixture of self-deprecating humor, heartfelt vulnerability, and dishy asides, Rannells has written a book I will recommend to all my friends.

This guy knows how to write. He has a great sense of humor, is extremely vulnerable, and uses a common-sense approach to his sexuality that I wish all in the LGBTQ community would learn from. (Especially Andy Cohen, whose one-star Daddy Diaries I read the same week as this and the two couldn't have been more different.)                                      That doesn't make this book perfect and it feels more like four-and-a-half stars at times. The main issue is that it's simply too short at 236 small pages, and that Rannells fails to fill in some details in some of the stories. At times he's glib when he needs to be expansive. There are also a couple chapters that are purely space-fillers, including a silly what-I-did-today essay about him avoiding going to the gym (yawn!) and a worthless fantasy where he imagines living a Gilmore Girls lifestyle as an alternative career (snore!). Andrew, please instead write more entertaining insights about your work!                                      Those are balanced by a couple outstanding chapters, the chief one being ""The Christian, His Wife, and Me."" It should be must-reading for every gay, bisexual, or straight-but-bicurious man in how to deal with guilt and people of faith. Rannells handles the topic of cheating with an outwardly Christian married-to-a-woman coworker with such sensitivity that the author takes blame upon himself when he could have turned judgmental toward the hypocrite religious married guy. It makes Andrew stand apart from other LGBTQ authors who want to point fingers and scream about not being treated fairly by two-faced people of faith while failing to accept responsibility for their roles in making bad choices.                                      His sections on being on Broadway and trying to get jobs in Hollywood are excellent--they just could be longer and (I know I'm repeating) more detailed. Some spots seem a bit duplicative of his first book, but when he's good he's very good. He doesn't hold back on naming most names and gently throwing a couple people under the bus. Though a few are given fake names, Rannells does name his boyfriends and I was shocked to look one up to see it was the choreographer's real name!                                      The writer gets waylaid in a chapter claiming that his ""genetics"" have led him to become a very anxious person filled with fear. He calls it his ""natural predisposition toward unnecessary worry."" Um, that's not scientifically accurate. His issues don't simply come from his ancestor's genes and Rannells fails to address the truth that it's nurture, not nature, that gave him most of the bad habits.                                      The author's Catholic guilt actually leads to some interesting self-analysis. I like his conclusion that meeting with a therapist can be helpful to some, but it's not necessary to keep dragging it on. His final ""Uncle of the Year"" chapter (with a nicely stated rejection of using the word ""guncle"") is a bit depressing and too serious to end what should have been an upbeat finish, but otherwise he does a good job wrapping up chapters with a little twist or cute line. And while he champions his ten nieces and nephews, he throws a line in saying, ""I imagined bailing them out of jail, driving them to abortions, paying for rehab."" I'm hoping that was a joke.                                      He includes a fun chapter on doing Cameo videos and after reading this book I think he's one of the few celebrities I'd want to get one from, but I certainly wouldn't want him to be my neurotic uncle! Just read it and be grateful that there is one gay writer that understands how to put together a series of autobiographical essays as well as how to truly treat others respectfully and take personal responsibility.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","Candid, hilarious essays from the star of                                 The Book of Mormon, Girls,                                and                                 Big Mouth                                on anxiety, ambition, and the uncertain path to adulthood, which ask, how will we know when we get there?

And it got them from me! What I don't always understand is how the idea of this common mental illness is so undertreated in the world of psychology, except of course among women in whom it was first identified forty-five years ago. That makes sense because it's a subtle way of (in)validating women's power.                                      Actor Rannells is a gay man of a certain age writing about himself and his multivalent struggles to achieve success, find love, gain self-esteem and confidence, and then Own It. If Impostor Syndrome does nothing else, it weaponzes the ""virtue"" of modesty to create eternal insecurity and ""unworthiness"" in those not inoculated against those insidious underminers of personal satisfaction and empowerment by virtue of gendered, class- and race-specific messaging. Just look around at those whose self-esteem is most on public display to get the import of this effective means of social control.                                      Those reflections being delivered, the story itself is a laugh-out-loud collection of short essays, the precise proper length to be read while in down-time from tasks of ordinary living...waiting in waiting rooms, between required or assigned busy-work bursts...and they deliver not simply respite from these but quietly effective food for thought. Rannells has lived an active public-facing life. His reflections on how that's worked for him, what it's cost him, where it's led him, are both completely personal and universally applicable in their outlines. (Funny how often those things go hand-in-hand, isn't it?)                                      What I enjoyed most about the read was how much honesty Actor Rannells brings to his gayness. He denies, hides, celebrates, and ultimately integrates his sexual and romantic focus on his own gender in a social milieu, the theatre, where it's not exactly uncommon. The process isn't direct, and is never over...gay men never stop coming out...but it's a lot less time-consuming as he ascends the career ladder with candor and humor. Aging has its good points. He's in charge of his own life and future in ways he never thought he could be as a young gay man. But the eternal struggle to believe himself actually possessed of that power, and the deservedness of that success, that is the ongoing ""gift"" of Impostor Syndrome, is the quiet but inescapable burden of his humorously delivered anecdotes.                                      I'm older than Rannells, older even than his decade-plus older partner, and I still recognize and relate to all the struggles he underagoes. I found comfort, fellowship, and fun in this read. I hope you'll take it with you to the next doctor's office or bureaucratic waiting room you go into.                                      ***                                      Mini-rant incoming: Impostor syndrome is one of the most infuriating things I've encountered in my long, lucky life. Yes, it's real; no, it's not what They say it is. It's a maladaptive response to misogyny and other forms of cultural othering. It's the Straight White Man-God They install in you saying, ""you'll never, ever be enough because I say so"" operating as They intend it to: as a form of social control. If you always doubt yourself and your fitness and worthiness, They keep you in your proper place: Under/below/powerless. So a medicalizing diagnosis gets invented (not coincidentally in the 1970s when women, gays, and Black folk begin to gain some power over their persons and futures) for what really is a problem of social structure, designed to keep you Out, and convince you that (if you just work hard enough) you can overcome this flaw in yourself and your thinking. When you fail, They murmur, ""bad luck you pitiful woman/faggot/brown-skinned person,"" and recline comfortably atop Their mountain of prestige.                                      /rant","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","Candid, hilarious essays from the star of                                 The Book of Mormon, Girls,                                and                                 Big Mouth                                on anxiety, ambition, and the uncertain path to adulthood, which ask, how will we know when we get there?

While many would argue that it's the promise of a loving partner and children, Rannells challenges this notion in his new book, ""Uncle of the Year.""                                      ""Uncle of the Year"" discusses the struggles of coming into and surviving adulthood, with the unique experiences of being on Broadway and occasionally awkwardly rubbing Mark Ruffalo's back. With 20 chapters of hilarious and heartbreaking stories, this collection of essays gives readers the feeling of a deep, intimate conversation with Andrew Rannells that you've probably secretly fantasized about way too many times. No shame in it! Well, some shame.                                      While reading ""Uncle of the Year,"" I've come to realize two very important things about Rannells' writing. 1.) He is incredibly skilled in creating a personal connection with the reader. Throughout this book, Rannells speaks directly to the reader countless times, as if it were a conversation. I felt moved by his writing on a deeper level because of this, as it broke down the separation of the writing and the author. Rannells also carries a very familiar tone throughout the book, as if the two of you were longtime friends. This particular style invites for a stronger connection with Rannells while still maintaining an air of professionalism.                                      2.) Andrew Rannells is very skilled in making his readers cry. Not that this is a bad thing, obviously, but Rannells' stories deliver a specific relatability that easily overcomes the idea that he is simply 'Famous Actor Andrew Rannells™', but rather an intricate and complicated human being. With discussions of mental health, relationships, family, and addiction, Andrew Rannells allows his more vulnerable side to shine throughout the book. Rannells connects readers through a shared understanding that many of us are struggling with our own issues every day. In his excellent chapter titled ""What Words Can I Give You That Will Comfort Me?"" He states that, ""If we are brave enough to say how we are feeling out loud, hopefully those people will also feel brave enough to share their feelings with us"" (194). Rannells empowers and encourages readers to be vulnerable and genuine with others, noting that ""We are all alright,"" and ""We will get through this"" (195).                                      “Uncle of the Year” by Andrew Rannells is an incredibly heartfelt, emotional, and witty piece of writing. Rannells’ charisma and self-described ‘Midwestern Charm’ seeps through each page and creates an endlessly insightful read and gripping page-turner. In reading this book, I have cried an unhealthy number of times, but ultimately come through it with a deeper understanding of myself and how to move forward when life really sucks. With an oddly familiar tone and comfortable anecdotes, “Uncle of the Year” makes a great read for young adults and beyond looking to widen their perspective on the world at large and find compassion for themselves and humanity as a whole. I easily rate this book five stars, and I plan to reread it several times.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","Candid, hilarious essays from the star of                                 The Book of Mormon, Girls,                                and                                 Big Mouth                                on anxiety, ambition, and the uncertain path to adulthood, which ask, how will we know when we get there?

Andrew’s second memoir brings in a very intimate and delightful kind of joy that only a wonderful human and artist could bring to a piece of personal nonfiction.                                      This time, Rannells brings the reader even closer to specific memories, narrating different stories at sporadic moments of his life. Ranging from dehydrated-lip performances filled with thrill, to fun anecdotes as a young artist in NYC, the book has it all!                                      What I most enjoyed about this was the gripping storytelling Rannells brings to his memories, most specifically the way he seems to take the reader deep into his brain and make it feel extremely comfortable almost immediately. There’s a certain charm that he has that is palpable both on stage and on paper, and that’s a talent that was very rewarding.                                      Rannells isn’t afraid to admit to his mistakes and portray flawed versions of himself to engage the narrative. Each fun anecdote was a life lesson for him yet it somehow translates to become a life lesson for the reader. I laughed, teared up, and most importantly, felt extremely connected (once again) to Rannells and his world.                                      The raw honesty combined with his great humor feels relevant and fresh at every point of his life that he decides to narrate. I even found myself briefly putting the book down to Google names, events, and performances that Rannells mentioned throughout, which made the experience extremely fun and engaging, especially as a big fan of his.                                      One note I’d point out would be the tone shift in one or two stories near the end, where the narrative felt too disjointed and not a part of the same book. Even then, it being a collection of memories, some will be more appealing than others.                                      There’s a big payoff after reading this that is quite rare and beautiful. An artist with so much experience telling his story in such a vulnerable way is valuable and the way Rannells decided to do it felt engaging to a higher level.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","Candid, hilarious essays from the star of                                 The Book of Mormon, Girls,                                and                                 Big Mouth                                on anxiety, ambition, and the uncertain path to adulthood, which ask, how will we know when we get there?

I didn't realize the was one of the original cast members of The Book of Mormon, and while I knew he could sing, I didn't realize he was a belting tenor. Overall, I found his writing style to be honest, humble, and down-to-earth and I really enjoyed reading about his experiences and reflections about what has made him the man he is today.                                      This memoir was a refreshing change from some that seem to list their accomplishments and all the famous people they've met. Rather, Andrew reflects on his life and what he thinks it means to be ""an adult"". I especially found his thoughts about therapy and his relationship with it to be insightful, and I could feel some of the darkness that he shared during the pandemic. The chapter that talked about his experience with Cameo was especially poignant.                                      While he does mention some very well-known people in this book, he focuses on what the chance meetings meant to him and how much he appreciated their kindness. Two examples of that were when Paul Rudd looked out for his family at the Tonys even though they had never met, and when Hugh Jackman encouraged him just before he went on stage. I also loved hearing about his best friend Zuzanna Szadkowski, and how that friendship has carried him through even the toughest of times. I have no idea who she is because I don't watch tv, but she sounds like an amazing friend.

I admit I hadn’t known much about him before reading this book, but I was impressed with his candor and humor. Much of the book relates to his career like auditioning for the Book of Mormon. One of my favorite essays is Saigon in the Finger Lakes. He was cast as Chris in Miss Saigon. During his stay in the Finger Lakes he wrote numerous amusing letters to his friend, Zuzanna. The essay is primarily the letters.                                      Andrew delves into growing up. One question is when do you know you’re an adult: when you have a house, a career, a lover? I found his musings quite relevant. How do any of us know when we’re grown up.                                      In the context of family, he talks about being an uncle. He never wanted to have children and was startled when his brother and sisters began to produce off-spring. He knew he wouldn’t have children, so he decided to become a good uncle.                                      I enjoyed his writing style. It is very conversational making you feel like you know the other person. I think the audiobook might be even more enjoy because the author’s style lends itself to the spoken word.

She could help support her parents just as they always supported her. She could be open about who she was. But there was a limit to how far pageants in the Philippines could take her—financially, but also, crucially, in terms of having her gender legally recognized.                                      In the US, Rocero could have it all: the magical                                       F                                      on her government documents, a modeling career (with a rise nearly as rapid as her pageant rise in the Philippines), relationships and steady income and recognition. But in the US, it was not possible to both be openly trans and to work as a mainstream model—the few who had come before her and been outed had been shunned, demonized, and excluded. And thus began years upon years of going ""stealth,"" keeping the sex on her birth certificate a secret so that she could live the high-fashion life in front of the cameras that she had dreamed of.                                      It's so easy to forget just how far things have come since the early 2000s—there's still so far to go that sometimes it feels like there's been no progress, but of course Rocero is painfully on point, and I'm grateful to have this reminder of how complicated identities are for so many. There's some fascinating basic background on the Philippines here that makes me want to read more about that—a Catholic country because of its colonizers, but with a rich cultural history that included acceptance of something much broader than a binary gender system. The Philippines of Rocero's childhood, then, was a place where it was not always                                       accepted                                      to be trans—but where the trans community was so visible that there was at least always a baseline understanding. It sort of boggles my mind that she could be so successfully ""stealthy"" in the US (side note: ""passing"" is not really a term she uses in the book, so I won't either, and Janet Mock's                                       Redefining Realness                                      is as relevant a read as ever) but also be so sure that anyone from her homeland would be able to clock her in short order.                                       Horse Barbie                                      details years full of joy and successes, but also a heavy load to carry. It's one thing to know who you are, but another thing to know how badly people might treat you for something as simple as your identity. Rocero never lingers on the heavy parts, but she also doesn't let the reader sit back and think that it was all easy. I'm grateful for that, too, because one of the reasons I read memoir is to be catapulted into someone else's life for a while, with all its complications, and I'd be remiss to come away thinking that the Philippines was a bastion of acceptance, or that success in the US made having to hide okay—because it might have been worth it to Rocero, to a point, but she should have been able to live her life without fearing what discovery might mean.                                      As is not uncommon, there's so much more that I want to say than will fit in a review of reasonable length, so I will leave it with just two notes: first, whoever is doing memoir acquisitions at the Dial Press has killer taste—all of the memoirs I've read from them in the past couple of years have been somewhere between excellent and exceptional. And second, a round of applause for Rocero's mother, who sounds like the sort of quiet champion every kid figuring out their identity should have.

If I could give one rec for #pridemonth it would be Geena Rocero’s recently published memoir, Horse Barbie.                                      Rocero is an award winner producer, model, and Transgender Rights Activist who immigrated from the Philippines to the US when she was a young adult.                                      Before moving to the states she had risen to the top of the pageant world and was recognized in her culture as transgender, but after coming stateside, she lived her life in secret for about 9 years before coming out to the world in 2014 during a @ted talk.                                      In the book Geena describes “learning to be trans in the Catholic Church” , her parent’s acceptance, the cruelty that can offer be found on the pageant circuit, her amazing support system, and her life as a successful yet stealth model.                                      I thought her commentary on the dichotomy of being culturally visible in the the Philippines with no legal gender rights verses her being legally recognized in the US but still feeling unseen and not visible was interesting and gave me much to think about . Her story is bold and she is brave for sharing and speaking out and advocating for affirmation for trans youth.                                      Her message is clear :                                      “That’s the thing about trans joy: It can never be fully extinguished. People can try to narrow the possibilities for our lives, even and them, but our spirits will always expand to feel whatever space we are given. We will find the power in us.”                                      I am so thankful that @phenomenalbooks chose to highlight Horse Barbie for June. It was a pleasure to read Geena’s journey.

Pre-reading:                                      I fully requested this book for the title and the cover, and knew nothing about the subject matter, but now I’m intrigued. How on earth did this book get its title?                                      Thick of it:                                      See, this is what is so frustrating with today’s conservative critics because it’s like it’s not just now that trans models are coming into the culture. They’ve always been there. They’ve always existed. You just personally didn’t know that they were there, but now that you know that this woman you wanted to fuck doesn’t have the right parts for you, you feel like it’s a bait and switch and like it’s an attack on you. It has nothing to do with you. She wasn’t yours to fuck and objectify to begin with. Not every advertisement has to be catered to your preferences.                                      The more I learn about the 2000s, the darker it seems for women, and I can’t believe I grew up in that and came out like this. No wonder all the girlies of this generation are so mad.                                      sampaguita                                      eskinita                                      kembot                                      palengke                                      apparador                                      daster                                      banderitas                                      isaw                                      lumpia                                      sisig                                      kuya                                      chismis                                      That’s so interesting that people think of tee shirts as their hair because it’s a thing on TikTok where men do skits impersonating women and they put a towel or they put a shirt on their heads, but like I’ve never thought of towels or shirts as my hair.

I googled her and she’s a stunning model.                                      japanera                                      wa buking                                      What the actual fuck Evan?                                      I dunno masturbating in front of your friend to reassure them is a wild concept to me.                                      Jersey is the armpit of America, but the body needs an armpit.                                      I understand why she’s not disclosing to her partners because she doesn’t want to jeopardize her career, but I think it’s fundamentally wrong not to tell your partner something like that. I understand the danger that comes with telling people that you’re trans, which is shit, but I think that’s a conversation that you really need to have because if they react badly to it, why on earth would you want to be with them? Otherwise, you’re living in willful ignorance, which seems disingenuous. And then, if you do tell your partner after you’ve been together for a while, I think a lot of people would have a hard time letting go of the fact that they’ve been lied to, even if it’s a lie of omission. There’s a big problem nowadays with dating apps and how people lie about their height or they Photoshop their pictures. I think all of that is wrong. You can’t get into a healthy relationship without representing who you are authentically. There’s this whole misguided, unspoken rule that you shouldn’t discuss politics on a first date, but I wanna know if you’re a piece of shit from the get-go. Moral compatibility should be one of the first conversations you have in my opinion. Get those relationship deal-breakers right out front. Give people the opportunity to show you who they are, and if it’s not something compatible with you, then they shouldn’t be your partner.                                      colazione                                      Even her mindset here, she’s so preoccupied with losing this man, and I’m like if he doesn’t accept you, you’re not losing him. You weren’t meant to have him. He doesn’t deserve you, if he can’t accept you. You deserve someone that loves all of you.                                      It’s wild to me that surgery has come so far that you could not notice.                                      Pretty privilege is real.                                      Her closing lines are really strong.                                      Post-reading:                                      Memoirs are so impossible to rate.                                      Because it’s not that someone’s life isn’t interesting enough or their perspective on their own life isn’t good enough, but like I crave some oomph, I crave some bite to my books. This doesn’t have that. It’s musey. It’s reflective. It somehow lacks emotion for me. There’s no anger in this book, and that feels impossible to me given her story and the state of the world. And then I sit here like is that even a fair criticism because I don’t wanna tell her how to feel about her life? From a narrative structure though, this book doesn’t really have any tension because there’s no problem to resolve. It’s essentially a timeline of her life. And I think it’s bland and anesthetized into not saying anything. This book has no hot takes. It doesn’t rail against the fashion industry, or racism in America, or transphobia in the church. It almost feels willfully ignorant at times of pretty privilege and the problems within those industries or communities. I think there’s a rather pointed absence of feminism discussion in the book. The only bits of other women in this book that we get to see are friends supporting her career or competition being envious of her. I feel like this book has ignored the mindsets and morals of the people she’s working with. Like what do the other models think about her status? What are their opinions on it? There’s no answering back to any people that would criticize her. Especially in the current environment that this is being published in, I don’t understand why there isn’t a chapter or two where she justifies herself to her critics. There’s no discussion about why she’s a fit model to advertise for “women’s products” like lingerie or makeup or whatever. (Which don’t get it twisted. She’s absolutely a fit model. She’s stunning. Products are for whoever wants to buy them.) Bud Lite and Target and so many other brands are dealing with the backlash from transphobic consumers. That conversation needed to be in this book. And then I think it’s irresponsible to have a book that talks about the modeling industry without acknowledging how inherently sexualized and objectified it makes people.

We will find the power in us.""                                      Horse Barbie by Geena Rocero is a triumphant, beautifully introspective memoir exploring the trans experience.                                      Growing up in the Philippines, Geena knew she felt different. Not feeling like she matched her assigned gender at birth, she chooses her female identity at a young age. A striking beauty, she finds her success in trans beauty pageants where she was referred to as Horse Barbie. At the height of her pageant success, her mother brings her to the US for better opportunities.                                      What she finds there is a culture shock. The US is supposed to be the land of dreams but she feels pressured to be more secretive about her identity. An immigrant in a new country, she works hard as a model while grappling with the constant anxiety of being outed as a trans woman and losing everything. The more success she finds, the riskiest it feels to be truthful about who she is and the more she struggles with her connection to her own identity.                                      Geena writes beautifully, with a candidness and familiarity that immediately connects the reader with her and her story. I found myself equal parts inspired and wanting to be her  friend; her charming personality leaps off the page. I appreciated her introspectiveness, and the way she conveyed this in her storytelling.                                      I loved how Geena added color to her story by including details like historical and cultural anecdotes. Ideas pertaining to colourism, colonialism and religion in the Philippines, make her experiences even more vivid.                                      Horse Barbie is the perfect read for Pride Month. It will touch your heart,  make you laugh, make you feel hopeful and more connected to yourself and to those around you, especially to our queer community. You'll want to read this one.","320 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","The heartfelt memoir of a trans pageant queen from the Philippines who went back into the closet to model in New York City—until she realized that living her truth was the only way to step into her full power.

It was insightful, creative, and genuine. Rocero brings so much to the table; intimate details are shared as if they were to a friend. While this memoir had a clear point of view, there was never a moment where it felt like Rocero was preaching.                                      The book's construction was simple but highly intelligent and expressive. There were times references to earlier parts of the book were copied and pasted rather than acknowledging the connection and trusting the reader. That being said, ensuring the reader connected and understood the book's message was more important than playing with allusions and risking losing impact. There were a few moments where reductions could have been implemented by having a bit more trust in the reader: repetitive sequences (nightlife; noting that this is an important part of finding community, but not the only way), the copy-paste references, and/or moments of rote explanations.                                      ""Horse Barbie"" had a significant spiritual element to it. I felt connected to Rocero and was eager to learn more. The discussions of organized religion, colonization, and political oppression juxtaposed with the vivid, tenacious, creative, and colorful lives of the Author and the LGBTQIA+ community was a true gift.","320 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","The heartfelt memoir of a trans pageant queen from the Philippines who went back into the closet to model in New York City—until she realized that living her truth was the only way to step into her full power.

In her memoir                                       Horse Barbie                                      , model and transgender rights advocate Geena Rocero takes us from the city streets of the Philippines, to Filipino transgender beauty pageants, to San Francisco cosmetics counters and bars, to New York photo shoots and clubs, to exotic vacation destinations around the world, and to podiums and political events across North America. As a reader, you see and learn so much.                                      Rocero’s life story is certainly a unique one. She shares the difficulty of not being fully embraced in either her home country or her adopted one. In the Philippines, gender fluidity has roots in pre-colonial culture and teenaged Rocero was able to publicly embrace her femininity and rise to the top of the trans beauty pageant circuit; however, the conservative political climate meant she couldn’t be legally recognized as a woman. After emigrating to the U.S. at 17 years old, she saw the flip side of this—she was able to change her name and gender marker on legal documents and earn enough money for gender affirming healthcare and surgeries, but she felt she had to go back into the closet as a trans person in order to have a successful modeling career. While she did have the support of family and a small circle of friends, Rocero struggled with difficult dualities—with being confident and bold in her career yet paranoid and fearful her secret would come out and destroy her success, and with the joy of having her outer body match her inner self but also the burden of hiding her scars and her past.                                      For the most part, I did enjoy Rocero’s memoir and found the book fascinating. The writing style did become a bit slow and uneven during her chapters about modeling in New York. Given the internal conflicts she was experiencing, this could have been the most interesting section; however there seemed to be emotional distance and repetitiveness as she recounted her modeling jobs and dating life. Nonetheless,                                       Horse Barbie                                      is still very much worth the read because of its international and spiritual journeys and its message of self-acceptance and social equality.","320 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","The heartfelt memoir of a trans pageant queen from the Philippines who went back into the closet to model in New York City—until she realized that living her truth was the only way to step into her full power.

Finding fame, success, and her new found family in the trans pageant world, Rocero became the highest-earning trans pageant queen at the age of 17.                                      But when she moved to the U.S. just a year later, she hid her trans identity for survival. She quickly learned that it’s one thing to finally get legal recognition—that elusive “F” on your government documents you can get in the States but not in the Phlippines—but entirely another to openly live as a trans woman and find work as a model. Rocero had to go “stealth” and as she became more successful as a mainstream model, the stakes and her anxiety got higher and higher.                                      I learned a lot in this book, both in lessons of history as well as empathy. Transgender pageants are considered a national sport in the Philippines, which makes sense once you know that they honored gender fluid identities before colonization. Mix that historical sentiment with Spanish festivals for Catholic saints and U.S. beauty pageant culture, you get the rich trans pageant culture that exists today: a colonial by-product. I could honestly read a whole book dedicated to this topic because that is a history lesson I would gladly sign up for.                                      But more than the history lessons, I was most impacted by the lessons in empathy. And not because Rocero was trying to teach or preach in her memoir, but rather because this was the first trans memoir I picked up (I’m not proud of that admission). And by doing so, I, as a cishet woman, got a firsthand look at the vulnerable and precarious life of a trans woman. There is a moment in the book, after she moves to the U.S., when she talks about watching daytime talk shows like Jerry Springer and Maury Povich and seeing the transphobia and taboo fixation of trans people play out on screen. Parading trans people on stage and having the audience play guessing games, like some kind of circus game. As Rocero watched, shame filled her. And as I read, shamed filled me. Because I remember watching those shows as a young child during summer break, horrified at the idea that such people existed. This is the only time I cried while reading the book. It was the first time I was so consciously aware of my own transphobia, and at such a young age. Don’t get me wrong, I am not blaming my young self nor the author for conjuring this memory for me. But rather, I am incredibly grateful and happy that I read this memoir, that these memoirs can and do exist today. This is a memory I would’ve never returned to on my own, and I thank the author for bringing me to it and for allowing me into hers.                                      I said this was the only time I cried, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t heavy and sometimes, downright scary moments in the book. There are and I can only assume they could be triggering for some. But, Rocero doesn’t dwell on such dark times because there is so much joy in this book. This book is about survival and self-love. And for the cisgender, this book is a reminder that it is so incredibly important to read lived experiences other than your own. I promise you will be a better person for it.

That said, Horse Barbie made it easy for me. This memoir follows Geena Rocero through her years as a Trans Beauty Pageant Queen in the Philippines through her experiences modeling in the United States. This was emotional, informative, and quite interesting. Really, it has a bit of everything that you'd want in a memoir.                                      I will say that there were some moments in this book that were very hard to read, but they are meant to be that way. When Geena is trapped into hiding her identity by the fear of losing her career, it feels like a gut punch. You want her to be able to be open and honest about who she is, but you also understand the risks that come with that honesty. Its heartbreaking and frustrating.                                      I also really loved the way that this book compared perspectives on Trans people in The Philippines versus in the United States. It was interesting that in The Philippines there was no legal recourse for gender or identity changes, but generally there is social acceptance where as in the US, there is legal recognition, but existing comes with the potential of physical danger, loss of jobs, and discrimination. We often think of the US as quite progressive, but this really highlighted how in a lot of ways we're still quite far behind.                                      And I loved the representation of Filipino culture in this book too. I grew up in a predominantly Filipino neighborhood in the States, so for me elements of this book reminded me a bit of home. In particular, I love the discussion of the role of Catholicism alongside Trans acceptance culturally. The discussion of beauty pageants as a national sport was also amusing/interesting.                                      All in all, if you want a look inside the world of modeling and pageantry, deep understanding of one individual Trans experience, and a bit of Filipino culture, you'll likely find this book enjoyable. Rocero is an excellent speaker and storyteller and her voice makes this a very enjoyable memoir.                                      *Thank you to Netgalley, Geena Rocero, and Random House for the E-ARC of this book.

Far too often we’re taught by popular culture that queer community doesn’t exist outside of the western world and that, if trans people existed before 2000, they led repressed lives without access to community or care. These are vast oversimplifications which are challenged and dismantled in Geena Rocero’s biography. I’ll admit that I myself had fallen into these traps, so I was honestly amazed by the stories Rocero told – of the popularity of trans pageants in the Philippines even decades ago, of her transition from a relatively young age, of how the makeup counter at the Macy’s she worked at was known to be where the trans Filipina women worked. This biography provides a window into a world that many of us aren’t aware of – that, in fact, has been deliberately obscured and hidden from us by a culture that wants to teach us that to be queer, especially trans, is to be alone, that we have no history, that we should be grateful for the scraps that western culture is willing to throw us because to live anywhere else is to experience these mistruths tenfold. Rocero certainly doesn’t pretend her life was perfect anywhere, and she is unflinching when she discusses the legal erasure she faced in the Philippines and the social erasure she faced in the U.S. But she also exposes the inaccurate, colonialist ways we’ve been taught to think, simply by sharing her story. Now, to be honest the writing style of this book wasn’t quite right for me. I don’t know why, exactly, it just didn’t quite click and I often found my mind drifting or wanting to go to bed. That’s the only reason this wasn’t a perfect five stars. But I think that was more of a personal preference than a serious problem with the writing, and I still stand firmly by my belief in the importance of this book and the belief that everyone – queer, straight, trans, cis, white, not white – should read it.","320 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","The heartfelt memoir of a trans pageant queen from the Philippines who went back into the closet to model in New York City—until she realized that living her truth was the only way to step into her full power.

Much of her life, as she presents it here, is caught between recognition and safety - it seems she cannot have both. In the 1990s and 2000s Trans people are culturally visible and valued but legally erased, whereas in America one can change ones gender and name but coming out as Trans risks violence, job loss and ridicule.                                      Her joy at pagenting, dressing up, going clubbing, being with friends and dating men is infectious. I do not like clubbing but enjoyed how she wrote about it.                                      „That's why, when young queer and trans people ask me about our nightmarish present, I don't tell them your problems will go away. I tell them that there is healing to be found in searching for joy, in processing your resentment for a world that rejects you, in accepting that all of being alive- the good, the bad, and the hateful- is part of a journey you don't get to do over. It will be difficult. It will be sad. I have the scars to prove it. But we will have one another and you will                                      have you.                                      Because no matter how scared you might feel -whether you're a trans kid or a ninety-year-old grandma- you have one of the most powerful things a person can wield: a story. A story worth sharing; a story worth living. You have a place in this vast tapestry of interconnected experience. Ecstasy and pain and romance and dream-making. all belong to you just as much as they do anyone else. Find your place among these feelings. Dig deeper.

While the books had its ups and downs, I ultimately think it's a really solid memoir, and I really enjoyed my time with it (for the most part).                                      To me, the first part of the book, detailing the author's early life in the Philippines, was by far the best. I love learning about life in different parts of the world, and it was fascinating to get a glimpse into the world of trans pageants in the Philippines.                                      Where I struggled more was in the third part of the book, about Geena's time in New York, where the focus is primarily on her modelling career, clubs, parties, romance and sex.                                      And look, there's nothing objectively wrong with writing about any of that, it's just very far from what I am personally interested in reading about (hell, I'm not really interested in any of it in real life either). I had really been enjoying the book up to this part, but around this point I was really struggling to keep going.                                      Luckily for me, things did pick up after that in the last part of the book, and ultimately, it managed to get me back to a place where I really liked the book.","320 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","The heartfelt memoir of a trans pageant queen from the Philippines who went back into the closet to model in New York City—until she realized that living her truth was the only way to step into her full power.

I ended up really enjoying this book. The writing style has a nice flow and is easy to read. Rocero has had an interesting journey from beauty queen to model to activist. There are a few stories that are a little silly -- like when the author convinces her boyfriend's mother to let them sleep in the same room by cooking for her -- but all the stories seemed meaningful to the author.                                      At one point, I started to think that Rocero has lived a pretty charmed life which was almost off-putting. But, as I read on, I think that she is just *really* confident and has the attitude that everything that happens to her is fascinating At the end of the book, I found myself realizing that this was a story about joy. For all the crap that Rocero and other trans folks have had to go through, it was refreshing to read a story that acknowledges those experiences and sees the value in the entire journey. She also had a strong support system which helps.

When she's discovered behind the makeup counter at Macy's and is thrust into the fashion world, Geena goes back into the closet, ""stealth"" modeling in order to protect herself.

It will be difficult. It will be sad. I have the scars to prove it.

In a country devastated by war and violence, where girls are often married off before reaching their teenage years and prohibited from leaving their homes, heeding that call seemed both impossible and dangerous.                              Pashtana was raised in an Afghan refugee camp in Pakistan where her father, a tribal leader, founded a community school for girls within their home. Fueled by his insistence that despite being a girl, she mattered and deserved an education, Pashtana was sixteen when, against impossible odds, she was granted a path out of the refugee camp: admittance to a preparatory program at Oxford. Unthinkably and to her parents’ horror, she chose a different path. She chose Afghanistan.                              Pashtana founded the nonprofit LEARN and developed a program for getting educational materials directly into the hands of girls in remote areas of the country, training teachers in digital literacy. Her commitment to education has made her a target of the Taliban. Still, she continues to fight for women’s education and autonomy in Afghanistan and beyond.

The book would make a great companion for middle or high school readers, or a women's study program. It expands a view of world history and the message that education can never be taken for granted. This book places us in Afghanistan and Pakistan, two countries that are in the news, and yet from which few first-hand accounts have made it out of those countries (for many real-world realities.)                                      Pashtana Durrani is a remarkable young woman who speaks from the heart, and honestly about being fallible. This book deserves a good audience. My only wish is that we knew more of an epilogue of where she is today, as a result of her efforts and events at the end of the book. I'd say more but no spoilers. A set of discussion questions would add to the conversations this book is sure to generate. As I know little of Afghanistan beyond American news, a map would be helpful for a visual of travel distances, borders and settings.                                      The book is a recommend.

Last to Eat, Last to Learn is a “must-read” work of nonfiction that puts an honest and human face on both the tragedy and the everyday courage of this complex country through the person of a young woman who, frankly, shows resolve and courage most of us can only wish we had.                                      Pashtana Durrani has a voice that is committed, outspoken, and at times humorous. And her writing, along with the assistance of co-author Tamara Bralo, reflects this on every page. Pashtana as a protagonist is instantly likable and relatable and somehow these characteristics make her accomplishments all the more amazing.                                      The result is a book that is entertaining, engrossing, and that flies by way too quickly. The story of Pashtana’s still only twenty-something life starts out with the feel of a teenager’s autobiography and then immediately starts to build and build until, all of a sudden, it turns into something that feels like a movie that needs to be made.                                      And this is a book that NEEDS to be read and read specifically by American women who, through the benefits of our privilege, have no idea what it is like to be denied an education because of our sex, run from our homes in fear of our life, or be trapped and isolated in a marriage before even entering puberty.                                      We need to teach our children to have the same empathy for their peers living on the other side of the world as Pashtana had, and has, for the girls she is trying to help. We need to encourage them to find role models not in superheroes or pop stars but in regular people in incredible situations who are brave enough to do noble things.                                      Pashtana is such a role model; a modern day example of what one person can accomplish when they are moved by compassion, determination, and a sense of purpose.","224 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 23, 2023","“Pashtana’s story highlights the resourcefulness and bravery of young women in Afghanistan.

Her father is a Khan and it gives Pashtana a privilege to do and possess what others cannot possess. She’s allowed to ride the bike and went mingling with the boys. They lived in comfort in Pakistan. What overwhelming is the fact that the father - a large Aghanistani tribe leader wanted all of his children to be educated including the girls.                                      No feast lasts forever, they said - as so Pashtana’s life. The family lost their privilege because of the war and to escape ISIS and the Taliban. The effects later intrigued Pashtana’s awareness. It’s strengthen with her understanding when she visited her homeland and learnt that women are not treated equally. She dreams of providing education to these women.                                      Does it mean that she’d have to deal with the long held customs and a culture where women will always be put as a second-class citizen? Will she succeed?

Her family fled Afghanistan when she was a young girl and moved to a refugee camp in Pakistan, although her father, a Khan of a large Afghan tribe, continued to fight for Afghan independence. Inspired by what she had seen in her childhood, that education was not valued for girls and that without education, they had few life options, she returned to Afghanistan as a teenager determined to find a way to assist girls in remote villages who were unable to access traditional schooling. The memoir was well written and despite the pathos of the situation, injected a wry humor at certain episodes and clearly showed the impact of Pashtana's father, who taught her that her gender did not determine her value and that access to education was important for everyone.","224 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 23, 2023","“Pashtana’s story highlights the resourcefulness and bravery of young women in Afghanistan.

Pashtana was raised in an Afghan refugee camp in Pakistan where her father, a tribal leader, founded a community school for girls within their home. Fueled by his insistence that despite being a girl, she mattered and deserved an education, Pashtana was sixteen when, against impossible odds, she was granted a path out of the refugee camp: admittance to a preparatory program at Oxford. Unthinkably and to her parents’ horror, she chose a different path. She chose Afghanistan.                              Pashtana founded the nonprofit LEARN and developed a program for getting educational materials directly into the hands of girls in remote areas of the country, training teachers in digital literacy. Her commitment to education has made her a target of the Taliban. Still, she continues to fight for women’s education and autonomy in Afghanistan and beyond.

Unthinkably and to her parents’ horror, she chose a different path. She chose Afghanistan.                              Pashtana founded the nonprofit LEARN and developed a program for getting educational materials directly into the hands of girls in remote areas of the country, training teachers in digital literacy. Her commitment to education has made her a target of the Taliban. Still, she continues to fight for women’s education and autonomy in Afghanistan and beyond.

I hope readers will be inspired by her mission to give every girl the education she deserves and the opportunity to pursue her dreams.”—Malala Yousafzai                                In the spirit of                                 Our House is On Fire                                by Greta Thunberg, the astonishing and deeply inspiring memoir from a young Afghani activist, Amnesty International Global Youth Ambassador, founder of the NGO LEARN, and women’s education activist whose advocacy for the disappearing girls of rural Afghanistan has led to her being ruthlessly targeted by the Taliban.                                A Ms. Magazine Pick for Most Anticipated Feminist Books of 2023                                “Sparkles with humor and grit. A lovingly narrated, sharply nuanced memoir from a talented activist.”—                                 Kirkus Reviews                                STARRED REVIEW                              Inspired by generations of her family’s unwavering belief in the power of education, Pashtana Durrani recognized her calling early in life: to educate Afghanistan’s girls and young women, raised in a society where learning is forbidden. In a country devastated by war and violence, where girls are often married off before reaching their teenage years and prohibited from leaving their homes, heeding that call seemed both impossible and dangerous.                              Pashtana was raised in an Afghan refugee camp in Pakistan where her father, a tribal leader, founded a community school for girls within their home. Fueled by his insistence that despite being a girl, she mattered and deserved an education, Pashtana was sixteen when, against impossible odds, she was granted a path out of the refugee camp: admittance to a preparatory program at Oxford. Unthinkably and to her parents’ horror, she chose a different path. She chose Afghanistan.                              Pashtana founded the nonprofit LEARN and developed a program for getting educational materials directly into the hands of girls in remote areas of the country, training teachers in digital literacy. Her commitment to education has made her a target of the Taliban. Still, she continues to fight for women’s education and autonomy in Afghanistan and beyond.                              Courageous and inspiring,                               Last to Eat, Last to Learn                              is the story of how just one person can transform a family, a tribe, a country. It reminds us of the emancipatory power of learning and the transformational potential that lies within each of us.                               “An inspiring portrait of a change-maker in action.”—                                 Publishers Weekly                                A portion of proceeds from                                 Last to Eat, Last to Learn                                will be donated to LEARN, the NGO dedicated to providing quality education and healthcare to communities in conflict zones."

You know? There was a lot to like about this one - an interesting journey for a young man who lost his famous father and feels a little lost. I don't read much non-fiction, but this one seemed interesting. Because I'm forced to - I'm rating it 3.5, rounded up to 4.                                      I loved the first part of the book where the focus was on Luke's relationship with his father and the way the grief affected him. He decides to take off and leave his current life and expectations behind. I can totally see where that needed to happen.                                      He describes his travels in detail - in the beginning - and then it sort of falls off as he becomes more confused about his future and the journey he is currently on. If feels a little - privileged, poor me - but even he admits that. And this is his journey so it's not really for me to judge. I will say that there were a few references to girls that had me a little disappointed. Especially to a girl he strings along while sleeping with another girl on his travels. But, like I said - this is his journey and he is revealing his own personal journey so...                                      I enjoyed this book - the first half much more than the second though. I could relate to the grief and the career crisis from my younger years. It sounds like he is back on track with a purpose and for that I'm really happy for him. The love for his father is more than evident - and I did really like that he developed a stronger love for his mother when he was able to experience the things she loved. Thank you to NetGalley and Harper Collins Focus for the ARC to read and review.

Luke took on Tim's mantle, working for NBC news, trying to demonstrate that he deserved the spot covering national news without working his way up. After 8 years, and a conversation directed by the then Speaker of the House, John Boehner, Luke resigns his position and heads off to determine where he belonged in this world and how to do it without his dad.

For most of “Look for Me There,” Russert comes off as an entitled, bratty, white frat boy who has the opportunity to travel the world — something most of us can only dream of doing. If I could have thrown an audiobook against the wall, the chapter on Sri Lanka would have done me in. “He’s such an asshole,” I kept thinking. It turned around for me during Russert’s remembrances of his trips to the Holy Land. For the first time I felt he bared his soul, dug deep to show how this particular episode of his travels was, in fact, life changing. I’m glad I stuck it out.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","In  Look for Me There , Luke Russert traverses terrain both physical and deeply personal.

I’ve feared failing in a job and life that chose me, and I’ve feared not living up to the family name. I’ve feared the disapproval from my parents’ cohort, the best and the brightest of my hometown.”                                       Luke Russert was at a point in his life where he had it all, a sexy job in political journalism, life on The Hill, he knew all the right people and had all the right connections. On paper, it checked all the boxes of success. His life was set, just as choreographed. But his soul wasn’t set. Wise words from former House Speaker John Boehner nudged something in him and he eventually tossed all the certainty of his current life away to explore the world.                                        ”I think about my future, about marrying somebody deemed “worthy” by DC society, seeing my kids go to the same high school as I had, then attending the same galas I’m attending now, getting older, never leaving, ending up in the same cemetery as my dad. It suddenly feels terrifying.”                                       It is gag inducing to read how his “before” life was structured in so many ways, right down to who he dated. He sized up potential love interests not in the pure ways but from whether she would be presentable at galas, could she shake hands correctly, would people in his parents cohort approve?                                      These parts of the book are both eye opening and interesting. It surely had something to do with why he bailed. But it is just as much about someone trying to find himself while he confronts the grief he never got to sit with as it is lessons in history and humanity. His willingness to give up the sure thing to go for the unknown. That same willingness in exploring his sometimes painful family dynamics with his mom. His mother is an accomplished, and Emmy winning, journalist who approached life in a much more adventurous way than both Luke and his dad. She joined him for some of his travels. The relationship between them isn’t always smooth and he explores that history and how it’s still there in the present. His views of how she parented differently than his beloved dad and how it affected him are laid bare. I don’t know if traveling together helped change his perspective - what hurts hurts - but it did give him insight he might never have had otherwise.                                        ”Taken aback from watching her at work, I size her up. For someone in her seventies, she has not lost a step. Her energy is greater than mine. For the first time in memory, I want to be like her. I want to have this spirit to jump right in. It’s something my father never had. He was measured and cautious—nothing was left to chance. Mom is exciting, a true badass. She trusts in her abilities and is curious to get the full story, no matter how raw. I see her with new eyes.”                                       The places he visited and the people he met along the way balance the book out. They were fascinating to me from a historical perspective. Snippets of many places that are radically different than America but told from the perspective of a young American who, while more educated and worldly than the average American, can act pretty American in the worst ways at times. The flip side of that is he really does understand much of the painful history he confronts in his travels and brings nuance to it.                                        “A small portion of the museum is dedicated to the experience of American POWs. The history here is extremely propagandized. Pictures of American POWs playing basketball, eating Christmas dinner, drinking beer, and getting medical treatment hang on the surrounding walls. One plaque reads, “Americans were humanely treated while Vietnamese suffered.” History is written by the winners.”                                       There’s a lot to take away from this book. The author spoke about his journey and writing it when he was a guest on one of my favorite podcasts. But what sold me on reading it was a review here on GR. At one point the reviewer basically called him a self indulgent, white privileged jackass based on the chapter about his time in Sri Lanka. Surprisingly, the author responded with kindness and humility.                                      This was a quick read for me. I couldn’t put it down. I had tears in my eyes when I finished. Maybe it was the whole story or maybe it’s being a mom with kids not too far away from the age he was when his life was permanently altered, and seeing it from that lens. Either way, I’m rooting for him from here on out.                                      A bonus is he has an instagram where you can see many of the pictures he took during his travels. Hoping to find the one where he stumbled upon his ex and her husband in Red Square since it didn’t make the book. 😍","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","In  Look for Me There , Luke Russert traverses terrain both physical and deeply personal.

When I heard about this book coming out, I was nervous to read- I also lost my Buffalo Bills loving, charismatic, loving father unexpectedly in my early twenties.                                      The first chapter was so emotional and I was tearful over how much I could relate to Luke’s emotions at that time. You can feel his shock, unknowing, and need for something more out of life that he is now aware-is sometimes denied to even those most deserving.                                      Luke goes on to tell stories in beautiful detail about how he navigated his grief, learned and grew as a person through travel. This was so relatable and comforting to read.                                      Luke is aware of the privilege he has in his life to be able to travel. However, privilege and financial freedom is not equivalent to emotional/spiritual freedom nor emotional/physical health and this he has to work for throughout the book.                                      You can tell Luke feels travel in his SOUL. I loved the detailed way he describes his experiences and how he felt found, lost, and found again through his travels. And that is such an accurate picture of grief. I also loved hearing of the “god winks” (signs from a loved one who has passed on). Those are so personal but I love to hear of others experiencing those.                                      If you have had to navigate through unexpected grief/loss, I would highly recommend reading as this memoir has been the most comforting/relatable account I have yet to come across.                                      Thank you, Luke. This is a beautiful tribute to your dad, mom and yourself. He would be proud.                                      P.S. our dads have the best view from Heaven once those Bills finally win a Super Bowl.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","In  Look for Me There , Luke Russert traverses terrain both physical and deeply personal.

Loved Tim Russert. Read both his books and remember watching Luke’s eulogy for his father on TV. Because of this I am a big fan of Luke at msnbc and followed him on instagram. Knew he was working on this book from SF ( where I live) so yes I bought the audible the day it came out.                                      Big Tear jerker first chapter.                                      Wow. But then this pivots …What a great travel writer Luke is. Found myself going to look at his instagram to find the pictures. But there is a lot in this . Some highlights/comments                                      *Mom telling him to go to Bolivia                                      “You won’t get anywhere sitting on the sidelines. You can do it. “ love this encouragement.                                      Early chapter traveling with his mother is Raw and honest. Also love the tip of the importance of going to the mall. Brave of him to say. so honestly about how hard his mom was on him. Maureen orth - so impressive as a journalist herself. But how he writes about his mom through the entire book, her sense of adventure and interest in other cultures is inspiring to my 55 year old self.                                      *Valentine’s Day wave of grief in New Zealand. remembering his dad. Stacking the rocks. Lucky 7.                                      *Entire chapter on Vietnam. The history/conflict top place I want to go after Luke’s descriptions                                      *the entire Sri Lanka chapter Luke really comes across as a privileged ass….the mom in me was a bit disappointed but knew there was likely a bow ahead. His voice actually changes in the audible to sound like an ass.                                      *the opening day baseball story with his Dad I cried. As a huge baseball person fan ( Sf giants ) I totally understand.                                      *travel lessons like being comfortable with uncertainty. Being present right now. He portrays often with his stories. Luke talks about being at peace with aloneness and solo travel but there is a sense of loneliness often through book. Especially the last 1/3 of book.                                      *his visit to the Middle East at the end of book is special Like how he discussed some his family ghosts. and you see him make progress with working through grief of his fathers death. Enjoyed all his faith/catholic reflections through the book                                      Thank you Luke for sharing your honest vulnerable journey. We are all a work in progress.

After Tim died unexpectedly, Luke kept looking for his father, following in his footsteps and carving out a highly successful career at NBC News. After eight years, he realized he wasn't following his dream; he was following his father's dream, so he quit and went on a three-year journey across six continents to discover who he was and what he wanted.

I remember clearly hearing this news on the Radio and it stopping me in my tracks.                                      As an immigrant to the United States, I still find myself trying to understand the political and power systems- 33 years after arriving in Maryland from Europe. Tim Russert hosted “Meet the Press” on Sundays and I never missed it. He was a brilliant and relentless questioner who had a way of translating even the most convoluted answers given to him by his guests into language the rest of us could understand.                                      He was smart and disciplined- but I remember occasionally detecting a mischievous twinkle in his eye when I successfully cajoled an especially slippery guest into stating their position. Russert loved his job and I loved watching him do it. I learned so much from him and I trusted him. One of the guests at his wake was quoted saying what I would have said when asked by the author to share what Tim Russert meant to him:                                      “Your dad taught me American politics. Because of him, I could understand what was happening in my new country. I loved that man.”                                      I loved that man too. I remember thinking HOW can he NOT be the one to help me navigate the 2008 Presidential Race? I abandoned my Sunday tradition of “Meet The Press” after a couple of half-hearted attempts to get used to the new host.                                      I loved Tim Russert. I did not love this book, written by his only son- despite the fact that I’d been following his career closely and was definitely looking forward to the book. While I enjoyed some of the travel stories, they mostly felt formulaic- a privileged white American tourist, often acting a little too much like the stereotype. He often sounded spoiled- which I think was his attempt to make himself vulnerable to the reader. The writing didn’t grab me and the only place I felt like I connected with Luke Russert was when he’d share anecdotes about his complicated relationship with his demanding mother. I wonder what she thought about the way she was portrayed? Towards the end, when he finally stops running away from his pain and grief, he finally became more real. Picking up his running shoes and heading out to Rock Creek Park to tamp down his anxiety made him relatable to me. Closing the book with a spiritual journey to the Holy Land, i was never entirely sure that he found the closure he sought.                                      In the end, I realized that all of his bravado and sarcasm was hiding a grieving man who didn’t know how to process his feelings and was stuck at age 22, his age when his dad died. I understand the book wasn’t written for me, a random stranger who loved his dad and wanted to hear more about him.                                      Luke wrote the book as a way to stop running away from his pain and maybe, to find a little bit of closure. I congratulate him on doing this work.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","In  Look for Me There , Luke Russert traverses terrain both physical and deeply personal.

His pain radiates through the pages and I was extremely moved by his profound loss. I enjoyed the initial chapters, but found myself well and truly pulling faces by the time Luke reaches Sri Lanka. Luke is simultaneously aware of his privilege, and the “rich, white, American male” trope, but entirely fits that stereotype. He reveals his insensitive, petulant, obnoxious and irritating nature multiple times during the book. His disregard and dismissal of the Sri Lankan driver’s traumatic Boxing Day Tsunami survival was particularly gross. I relate to spirituality but the descent into pilgrimage and shouting to the heavens just took the book further south. He seems incapable of comprehending just how privileged he is. A shame it took such a departure from it’s initial pages.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","In  Look for Me There , Luke Russert traverses terrain both physical and deeply personal.

I may be a bit biased as I loved Tim Russert’s books in addition to his tv reporting. I was sad when he passed. This story told by Luke felt very real and transparent.

He shared thoughts and feelings we all struggle with - what is our identity, our purpose? Are we living for ourselves or others?

Chronicling the important lessons and historical understandings Luke discovered from his travels,  Look for Me There  is both the vivid narrative of that journey and the emotional story of a young man taking charge of his life, reexamining his relationship with his parents, and finally grieving his larger-than-life father, who died too young.  For anyone uncertain about the direction of their life or unsure of how to move forward after a loss,  Look for Me There  is a poignant reflection that offers encouragement to examine our choices, take risks, and discover our truest selves."

Soil tells the story of Camille's connection to the land, her ancestry and the roots of her passion towards caring for the earth and her own home garden as well as her experiences navigating race and the racial landscape of buying a home in a historically predominately White town in Fort Collins, Colorado.                                      Camille shares with us her own childhood experiences, the racialized experiences she observed her parents have to navigate through as she came of age, and the racial politics of creating and maintaining your own garden as a Black person in America.                                      Camille writes: ""Part of living successfully in community means accepting that people are always motivated by conflicting needs and desires- much as the blue spruce in the corner of our yard needs many things: root space, and water, and birds who thread between branches to open room where light and air can enter the thicket near the trunk. The spruce needs these things, not in some orderly succession, but all at the same time. For the most part, I have no control over whether the spruce's needs are fulfilled. But I can check the irrigation system to make sure it's not delivering too much or too little water, and I can be careful not to crowd the tree.""                                      Using her mastery of poetic language, Camille provides readers with several metaphors to understand life and the life cycle using the art of gardening and the practice protecting, preserving, and respecting the earth to help us understand nature's importance. The best part is that she shares her reflections and experiences via a pro-Black lens that speaks beautifully to our inherent connection to the land and the importance of reconnecting to it.

I don’t know any other that pulls off such graceful moves from the personal—her gardening—into explorations of racial inequity, from the racism in environmental writing to how it manifests in HOA rules. I learned a ton, both interesting facts like that a black man invented the lawn mower, or that microbes in the soil raise melatonin levels; and also ones that are kind of a bummer, like the fact that the Oxford junior dictionary is cutting lots of nature words in favor of more contemporary, “relevant” vocabulary like broadband, celebrity, etc., which I can sort of understand, but still makes me sad, as it further distances /acknowledges the distance our children live from their natural world                                      Here are some passages:                                      ""Whether a pot in a yard or pots in a window, every politically engaged person should have a garden. By politically engaged, I mean everyone with a vested interest in the direction the people on this planet take in relationship to others. We should all take some time to plant life in the soil. Even when such planting isn’t easy.""                                      “Harriet Tubman relied on signs and signals communicated by owls and snakes and moss and river currents. Such connections helped her safely conduct herself and others through a dangerous landscape. One made more dangerous by humans-made far more dangerous by humans—than by nature’s wild predations. Dr. George Washington Carver put words to the kind of radical connection on which Tubman relied. “I love to think of nature as an unlimited broadcasting station, through which god speaks to us every hour, if we will only tune in.”                                      “Maintaining the fantasy of the American Wilderness requires a great deal of work. It requires the enforced silence of women of Black people, Chinese people, Japanese people, other East and South Asian communities, poorer white people, Indigenous people, Latinx people, human children, wolf cubs, other small and large mammals, lives that thrived in wetlands, lives that thrived in gray land prairies, lives that thrived in the desert, flower people, fish people, bird people- the list goes on and on.”","336 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","A seminal work that expands how we talk about the natural world and the environment as National Book Critics Circle Criticism finalist Camille T.

For some topics, the connection to her garden was just not made strong enough. I didn't necessarily understand what this book was meant to be and the scope felt far too broad. A solid third of the book felt like reading a bunch of random literature reviews.

This was a wonderful memoir and commentary about the natural world and our interaction and engagement with it. The author starts from a place of gardening, mostly in her Fort Collins, CO home. She shares a bit of her story, gardening, plants, appreciation for the natural world, social justice and weaves it all together for a wonderful story of being a human on this earth. The writing is lovely as if you're taking this journey and learning alongside the author. It is also filled with interesting facts...we are overrun with male plants so we'd have more pollen and thus possibly leading to people having more allergies. One of the possible themes is how we as humans change and force nature to do our will, instead of letting nature do it's own thing (it knows best). I love that she may let the ""pests"" just be as it's all part of nature.

Dungy accepts a university position and transplants her family from Oakland, California to the predominantly white community of Fort Colins, Colorado. Her family has history with the town she left when only a toddler. In Soil, Dungy imparts her seven year journey to dig up her south lawn to create a drought-tolerant flower field and haven for pollinators. Like so many passages in her memoir, diversifying her garden reflects her heritage, and is a metaphor for the need to move away from the homogeneity that threatens society and the future of our planet. Soil is a compilation of Dungy’s personal reflections on her life, the history of women and nature focused writing, scientific facts, African-Americans in the diaspora and their connection to the earth, as well as socio-political implications for preserving the planet.                                      Soil at times reads like a diary and at other times scholarly treatise. The reader will have to be up for both. In its personal and socio-political scope, Soil brought to mind Robin Wall Kimmerer’s Braiding Sweetgrass. A perfect read for Spring!

I’ve been working on my own version of Dungy’s “prairie project,” where she takes on the work of transforming a conventional suburban yard into a native, pollinator-friendly patch of earth. The garden is ground zero from which Dungy digs into the history of America, the absence of mothers and Black and brown people in the canon of environmental writing, and the ways we oppress plants, animals, and people. The way she weaves personal narrative with social justice concerns, plants with people, and domestic life with environmental activism is like a literary garden. For anyone who has wondered if one person tending one small plot of land is worth the effort, Soil shows what’s possible for us all.

I think it’s an important book about a black woman’s view of her life, of the environment, of gardening and diversifying it. It’s a memoir but contextualized by history and the unknown future of her daughter, the close calls of being black in America.                                      I was saddened reading the story of dear Elijah McClain and his death at the hands of police in Colorado where Camille Dungy lives. I learned more about what happened and then I thought: why doesn’t someone make a film about these individuals whose lives have been cut down, or just about Elijah? I thank Camille Dungy for deepening my knowledge about this and more. The toxic environmental legacy in Oakland in the black community— a carelessness we see everywhere if we just connect the dots. Think of Flint Michigan.                                      I enjoyed Camille Dungy’s rambling thoughts and her vision of social activism, and her process of gardening. She is a poet.

Or maybe we're more like irises--able to withstand division. Thriving and flourishing in many climates and soils.”                                        ""No,"" Ray said one mid-June 2020 evening. ""We’re like dandelions. When they see us, they still try to kill us.”                                        Whether a plot in a yard or pots in a window, every politically engaged person should have a garden. By politically engaged, I mean everyone with a vested interest in the direction the people on this planet take in relationship to others. We should all take some time to plant life in the soil. Even when such planting isn't easy.                                      Excellent, amazing addition that should be at the top of the nature genre’s canon of most important works. I have loved her poetry for a while now, and I love that she lives in Colorado, and tried to amplify her work and voice in my small ways. Like Ross Gay, another poet writing about his garden, she weaves all the externals and internals, the personal and the political, and you can’t help but be charmed, cry some at the injustice she knows and relates, and changed.                                       The religious tradition I grew up in claims there was The Garden, where Adam and Eve lived in ease. And then, because of Eve's misdeed, there was the rest of the world. The wilderness into which they were cast. A world filled with labor and struggle and strife. I disagree. If the sweat and sore muscles of the original full-body workout yield spaces like the one where I stood that morning in Alphabet City, such a lot doesn't feel like a horrible fall from God's grace. In the photo we took in the garden, I am standing in a bank of maple leaves. I am looking off somewhere, toward other beings who thrive, as I believed myself, in that moment, to also be thriving. My smile is genuine.                                        Because in gardens I find hope.                                        Our garden regularly ruptures my sense of progress and process and time. There is the forward trajectory of days into months, seasons into years. June's tight rosebuds will lead to July's full-crowned blooms. Evident and irreversible change, straight forward as an arrow toward its mark. But there is revolution in the garden as well. And reversals. Months and seasons and days turning so far forward they bend backward. I stand in the past and in the future when I stand in the present of our garden. Just as with grief, neatly outlined stages double back and return well after or long before I expect them to appear or be over.                                        My family is the only Black family on our block. In fact, we are one of the few Black families in our entire town, the fourth-largest city in the state of Colorado. By few, mean that only 1.5 percent of people in this city of nearly 170,000 identify in US census records as African American. By few, I mean that any time Ray heads out on the bike trails, someone recognizes him by name. Callie is the only Black girl with two Black parents in her 440-student elementary school. This might help clarify my resistance to the kind of suburban American monoculture that the woman in my neighborhood tried to promote via the HOA's yard maintenance code. A culture that-through laws and customs that amount to toxic actions and culturally constructed weeding-effectively maintains homogeneous spaces around American homes.                                        But I am lucky. The neighbors I speak to claim to be grateful we moved in, cultivating the most heterogeneous environment on our street, both with our presence as a Black family and with our landscaping decisions. Our HOA eliminated its rules against ""nonstandard landscaping,"" and the town of Fort Collins actively works to help residents create landscapes that support native plants and insect populations and lower the strain on our precarious water supply. Bees love the flowers in our garden. Sunflowers shade low-growing plants at their bases.

Maybe I didn't see mothers in the canon of environmental literature because it has long been impossible for mothers to write narratives of a world where they can wander alone in the open, pausing long enough to let grasshoppers cat sugar from their hands. Maybe I don't see mothers in the canon of environmental literature because it's impossible for most mothers to create a world where they have nobody to think of but themselves.                                        Once outside, Dillard celebrated the isolation that sent her there. La la la. Walking through the woods, her pages seem to sing, not a soul to think about but me. The performance feels intentional, like Dillard plugged her cars and screamed, La la la. I'm not listening! In the years just before she wrote Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, white-controlled public schools in Virginia actively resisted federal mandates requiring the enrollment of Black children. One nearby standoff led to the 1968 Supreme Court case Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, which some civil rights historians say desegregated America's public schools far more expediently than 1954' Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. The Green decision impelled schools in Roanoke, through which the Tinker Creek of Dillard's book runs, to fully integrate by 1970.                                        That same year Cecelia Long became the first Black person to graduate from Roanoke's Hollins College, integrating the institution from which Dillard herself graduated in 1967 (with a BA) and 1968 (with an MA). The writer's husband, Richard Dillard, taught at Hollins. The couple lived just off campus. But Annie Dillard mentions none of these worldly details in her book about the world.                                        Though the turmoil of integration roiled immediately around her, Dillard maintained a willful segregation of focus and care. Borrowing some of Dillard's own language for a 2005 article he wrote in praise of her ""impish spirit,"" fellow solitary-wood-walker Robert Macfarlane said, ""In 1971... Dillard moved to Tinker Creek, a valley in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. She lived alone there for four seasons, in a house 'clamped to the side of the valley. 'facing, as she put it, the stream of light pouring down.”                                        Dillard prefers not to think of Pilgrim at Tinker Creek as a meditation on nature. Rather, she considers it a theological treatise. And so perhaps we have in her book an example of the call to see God in all creation. I appreciate that. I have looked for such connection all my life. Part of my drive to think so deeply about the greater-than-human world in direct relationship with my personal and cultural history comes from a desire to construct meaning from and connection with what is beyond me and also what binds me to the rest of the world. It's a spiritual question--and a practical one.                                        Aren't humans also animals-not set apart from but, rather, a part of the natural world? And an insistence on asserting the importance of those of us who are so often erased from or maligned in books held up as environmental masterpieces of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries?                                        Studies conducted from the 1960s through the late 1990s revealed that women's participation in conversations could be interpreted as excessive at levels as low as 30 percent. ""The talkativeness of women has been gauged in comparison not with men but with silence,"" said Dr. Dale Spender, a prominent researcher on the subject. ""Women have not been judged on the grounds of whether they talk more than men, but of whether they talk more than silent women.                                        Every time somebody, Black or white, says that the attachment I feel to land is strange, I think of those Sweet Briar Plantation families. Their fidelity to that place. Fidelity born from lack of opportunity and enforced by segregation, systemic racism, and often brutality. But that is not all. There is also a deep, abiding joy- an emotion derived from a sense of comfort, success, and accomplishment. On that land, men and women raised the next generations with an eye toward, and then in a state of, freedom. They fought hard to claim their welcome.                                        I've seen dogwoods bloom in the Virginia springtime. Their nearly excessive displays. Those notched crosses of white and pink petals. I've seen redbuds shoot out unrepentant bright buds, like a calendar, around Easter. Azaleas bursting out in technicolor purple and gold and magenta flower. Forsythia mimicking the sun, golden and dazzling. The plants in Virginia alone are enough to encourage a seeing person's site fidelity. Those plants grow up from land that generations of Black people carefully cultivated and tended and loved.                                        In a 2018 Oxford American article about Anne Spencer, praised the fact that Spencer ""was working at the intersection between environmental and civil justice."" Her work-as a librarian, a civil rights activist, a mother, a wife, a writer, a host, and a champion for the human and nonhuman lives around her--seems always and fundamentally connected. Spencer was able to integrate the many threads of her life, in part, because of her garden. In the book Half My World, a title taken from a line of Spencer's poetry, Rebecca T. Frischkorn and Reuben M. Rainey write, ""She used her garden as a restorative sanctuary to which she could retreat in fatigue, frustration, or sorrow, as well as in celebration."" The book's dozen photographs of Spencer in her house or garden all show her smiling. The kind of smile my own grandmother frequently wore. The kind my mother wears still. The kind that floods the body with joy's relief. The photographs span decades, but always that smile. Solid and monumental, resisting the dissolution of degradation and despair. In her home and garden, Spencer built a place that made her smile.                                        Here's a simple complication: What do I mean when I say the word nature?                                        Even as I build it, my answer shifts. I picture the simultaneously increasing and decreasing heft at the tops of the sand dunes Edward Abbey describes in Desert Solitaire. The instability that is the only stable truth beyond the angle of repose.                                        The national park set aside a large room dedicated to displaying Muir's work: the books and articles and letters he wrote, the organizations he founded, the land he helped preserve. Muir was a great man, these displays maintained. He successfully fought to establish and protect Yosemite, Sequoia, and Grand Canyon, some of the first US national parks. He helped found the Sierra Club in 1892, serving as its president until his death twenty-two years later. He devised a theory of glaciation that guided scientific and geological research for more than a century. His writing helped map this nation's imagination of its wilderness and how that wilderness should be managed. The displays in the museum suggested that I should be thankful for what John Muir left behind. But I wish I could have heard his wife, Louie, play her piano. I wish I could have tasted the cook's food. What of Muir's two daughters? Did they sing with their mother's music? I want the inside of Muir's house-the people there, that environment-also represented in his stories about the world he worked so hard to preserve. But that's not what Muir thought people wanted. Or, perhaps, he didn't consider those subjects worthy of his time and quill.                                        I am angry at Muir for what he left off his pages. Angry about the dismissive and degrading ideas about women and Black people, and Latinx and Native folks he included.                                        I don't believe John Muir or the foundational environmentalists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries had much interest in me. I mean that in terms of so many of the people who live inside me. Muir took Louie, the mother of his two children, to Yosemite once, but because her pace differed from his, and her fears and fascinations remained independent of his own, he grew annoyed. He never brought her along on his expeditions again.                                        Origin Story                                        Outside my window is the beginning of half my poems.                                        The others start outside my door. In cach case the window                                        is my body. I am always on the other side of the door. All summer                                        every place around me caught fire.                                        The flames orange haze spilled into my blood.

I was able to ask Dungy about the writing process, and the ease of the moment between the personal, the natural and the historical. Dungy said said that to match how she thinks and experiences the world, the book had to be written in a multivalent, radiant way—finding ways to mimic the patterns of how she thinks.

Soil is a memoir, the story of a Black poet and mother who works to transform her Colorado lawn into a natural, diversified place that matches and strengthens the natural landscape around it. This garden becomes a metaphor for her life and history as she relates her garden, ecology and nature to the political and sociological realities of Black people, women, and mothers.                                      This is a beautiful story. Although I’m not an expert on plants or flowers, you don’t have to be to enjoy this book. Dungy’s writing is beautiful and often poetic (not a surprise since the author is a poet), and her talent with words causes her stories to hit deeper than they otherwise might. There is a great deal of sadness in this book, but there is also a great deal of beauty.

2023-07-03,Soil: The Story of a Black Mother's Garden,,Camille T. Dungy,4.42,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Nature', 'Gardening', 'Race', 'Science', 'Biography']",Kindle $14.99,Patricia,Rating 4 out of 5,"May 2, 2023","Soil, Camille Dungy                                      Soil is alive. In a park, under your feet in the woods, in a garden you tend, even beneath all the green lawns, soil swarms with life and holds all that living entails – story, history, tragedy, and triumph.                                      Soil, Camille Dungy’s new memoir about her deepening relationship to the land, is an astonishing exploration of who we are and how we live. Dungy tells the story of creating a garden that reflects her history and imagination as the only Black woman in a white suburb with strict horticultural rules. Shifting through the various lenses of history, botany, and social justice, Dungy builds on the narrative with a wild curiosity and the juiciness of a poet’s voice.                                      Nature writing explores the deep call and response between the land and the human spirit. Nature writers see things we miss when we aren’t paying attention. They move us beyond the quotidian into the mysterious and then, like magic, they make that mystery part of our everyday lives and our days are suddenly more textured. They inspire us to, as Henry David Thoreau pronounced, “live deliberately” through awe, enchantment, and wildness.                                      Yet, so many nature writers such as Thoreau, Edward Abbey, and John Muir, speak from a solitary experience – a white, male solitary experience. Dungy isn’t having it. Soil is a nature writer sinking her hands into the story, history, tragedy and triumph that permeates the land – she fleshes out its life.                                      The experience of awe is transcendent. It takes us out of ourselves and our individual concerns and into a collective engagement with something else. Dungy leverages this awe experience, so available in nature, to bring our attention not only to the stunning and surprising more-than-human life that surrounds us but also to the oppression that is inherent in the land.                                      Dungy unearths, quite literally, the people who have long been, not only excluded from a place, but erased from their histories. She lays bare the elimination of women, especially mothers, from nature writing and spaces of the imagination. She reminds us of the lie of Manifest Destiny. And if language helps us shape our imagination, she asks, what does it mean when the 2008 revision of the Oxford Junior Dictionary removed words such as minnow, mussel, wren, heron, dandelion and replaced them with blog, broadband, celebrity, voicemail, and chatroom?                                      Weeds and invasive species become powerful metaphors in Dungy’s telling. We treat them with disdain, fight against them, poison them and prevent them from assimilating into our manicured spaces. Much as we do with Immigrants, people of color, queer and trans people, and anyone, really, who doesn’t fit the cultural narrative. This, Dungy reminds us, is our history…of weeds and invasives and it is deeply embedded. To acknowledge this and let it change us is also awe.                                      “A weed,” Dungy quotes her father, “is a plant that is growing in a place or way you don’t want it to grow. That’s all the word means.”                                      Soil is about acknowledgement and resistance. As much as it inspires us to grow, it also warns of the dangers when we sunder the land from the very thing that keeps it alive – then we’re only left with dirt. There can be no real relationship with the land – no awe – if we don’t listen to what it has to tell us. At one point, Dungy says, “One way I experience love is as delight in the flowering of another’s ideas. I want this book to offer such a flowering.” Accept this offer and our lives are richer for it.","336 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","A seminal work that expands how we talk about the natural world and the environment as National Book Critics Circle Criticism finalist Camille T.

Dungy,4.42,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Nature', 'Gardening', 'Race', 'Science', 'Biography']",Kindle $14.99,Judy,Rating 5 out of 5,"May 11, 2023","When I first saw Soil-The Story of A Black Mother's Garden by Camille T. Dungy was coming out, I pre-ordered it. I love reading about other people's gardens. Being a white, female gardener, I was interested in reading about gardening from another point of view. The book arrived a week ago, Tuesday and I immediately started reading it. Then I had to set it down to go find a pencil so I could mark passage after passage.                                      The book starts with Dungy's moving to Fort Collins, Colorado and then deciding to turn large sections of her yard into a 'prairie garden', planting native plants to benefit pollinators and wildlife. And then the topics expand further as she carries you through the process of making this garden and how it ties into her everyday life.                                      First she brings up the fact most 'nature' or 'environmental' writing is done by white males, such as Muir and Thoreau, who gained a lot of fame from their writing. However, nowhere in the books are things discussed like who does their laundry or the issues of doing their own laundry. Dungy talks about how, as women, we have to choose being 'doing the thing (writing)' and fixing dinner, minding the children, and the countless other things which are considered under the umbrella of women's work. In reading these books, Dungy states,                                      ""The authors' inability to see me means that I have trouble picturing myself in the worlds they depict. But I do exist. Instead of accepting erasure, I learn to write a story for myself.""                                      Written during the pandemic, Dungy was given a fellowship right before lockdown started, to write this book. Instead of having time to sit and write, she was now in charge of her 10-year-old daughter's schooling on a daily basis.                                      From there, she is talks about the different plants she wanted in her new garden areas, topics of segregation, how you prepare for a wildfire, Mary Cassatt, and many other topics and how they relate to her garden. So much in this book made me realize how little I actually knew about topics such as the history of segregation.                                      And while there are things as a white female I will not experience that a black female would, we do share so much in common. We both don't garden with gloves. We have to put actual skin to dirt in our gardens. She wants to bring wildlife to her garden - same here. The choices of caring for family versus caring for self.                                      I could go on for hours about how moving and thought-provoking this book is. And that I would love to sit in a garden and talk to Dungy about her garden and topics raised in SOIL. So I will say...

Thank you to the author, Camille T. Dungy, the publisher, Simon & Schuster, and NetGalley for an eARC of Soil: The Story of a Black Mother's Garden.                                      Before I talk about the contents, JUST LOOK AT THAT COVER! Isn't it beautiful? I was a bit worried the words couldn't live up to the promise of the artwork. They do. I fully acknowledge that this particular book dovetails with my particular interests - other readers with other interests might have a completely different experience reading it. For me, this book does everything and more I want in a reading experience: I was led down intellectually interesting paths, I felt so many real and earned emotions, I learned about topics I was already interested in and some I didn't know I was interested in until Dungy introduced them to me. The cover art, illustrations, and poetry all work to support and enhance the text.                                      First, this book has nuance. I don't know if I realized how much I was craving nuance until I found it here. Dungy tackles difficult topics, topics without easy definitions or morals. As someone who lives in community and is interested in the ecology of place, I live the tension between a garden which speaks to the neighborhood and one which honors the needs of wildlife. Second, this book earns its emotional beats. The picture of Dungy's mother, doing the dishes and talking about how her high school wouldn't let a Black girl be valedictorian will haunt me for a long time. Third, anyone who wants to explore any of the ideas discussed will find suggestions for further reading scattered generously throughout the pages. Dungy lives and writes in community and deliberately names the people her ideas are in conversation with - some already personal favorites and some new to me. Fourth, I really enjoy learning. I like learning the names of things. The history of a place. How things work. It is all fascinating, give me all the learning. A favorite from the book is finding out there are teams who deploy after a wildfire to help the landscape recover. Fifth, the personal, if told true, is universal. The glimpses into marriage and parenthood, into family and community life, all of it is told with such specificity, it becomes a shared experience. What a gift!                                      Soil is part memoir, part nature writing, part political treatise, part history of race in the U.S., part theological rumination, and all of it is thoughtful, wise, and compassionately collectivist.","336 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","A seminal work that expands how we talk about the natural world and the environment as National Book Critics Circle Criticism finalist Camille T.

I enjoyed the read, but she didn't. I'll explain both perspectives.                                      My friend's experience: She really enjoyed the parts of the book that dealt directly with Dungy's garden: the different types of plants, the plans to reshape and add more native plants, the way the garden affected her neighbors and friends and family, and even the stories about the wild animals in the area. But Dungy also weaves in tales of how her understanding of her garden is shaped by her experience in as a black mother in a mostly white community, writing in 2020, with the pandemic and the Black Lives Matters protests in the newspapers every day. My friend is ""over"" the pandemic and any talk about it; she does not want to give it anymore air than it's already gotten, so those parts were frustrating for her. As for the related writings about the deaths of black people (Trayvon Martin, George Floyd) and the historical absence of black writers (and really any people of color) in the naturalist literature canon, with a particular eye to women and working people, my friend felt like it could have been touched on less with an eye to moving forward.                                      My experience: Yeah, I did not expect the book to be about so many things as it was, but I don't think I was as bothered by the non-garden sections as my friend was. I appreciated the analogies Dungy drew between her garden and the current events in 2020, and I enjoyed following her meandering segments, finding the things that stitched each segment to the last one and to the next one. On more than one occasion, I slipped into some kind of meditating state reading her book and feeling how everything was connected in ways we forget to look for; those realizations made it difficult to slip back into my normal life. And I highlighted (on my ereader) so many quotes and writers' names to look up after I was done. It wasn't a quick read, but it was a good read.","336 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","A seminal work that expands how we talk about the natural world and the environment as National Book Critics Circle Criticism finalist Camille T.

Dungy did a beautiful job in weaving plants into racial injustice. When she spoke of racial injustices I was sad , though, that she did not include specifically Antisemitism.                                      Many of the author’s experiences aligned with my experiences as a practicing Jew, down to our experiences when we arrived at college. I read this book with two lens, one which others perceive me as a white Christian woman who could “pass” and the other as I am , a Jewish American woman who happens to have blond hair and blue eyes                                      When I walked into my college room the first time, my assigned roommate parents said they were so relieved that I was not Jewish. Imagine their horror when I said that I was indeed Jewish. ( The family profiled me from my name and where I came from). That night the daughter ,while I was sleeping looked for proof of my horns. I thought that action deserved my creative answer and that they were removed upon birth( btw, we don’t have horns).                                      As the sun rose and she hightailed to the supervisor of housing, she disappeared as my roommate. I was fortunate that two other wonderful ladies accepted me and we lived together for several years                                      Unfortunately, hate is hate and this author did an incredible job of sharing her journey. I’m excited to read other material by her. I’m frequently in Fort Collins and I will look for her garden. Her writing lifted me back to the streets of Fort Collins and its surrounding areas and how climate change has effected the land there.

I learned so much: There are male and female trees, and the USDA in the 1950s suggested planting more of the male trees, which has contributed to unchecked high pollen counts.

I love how this is about encouraging diversity in all spaces: the garden, wildlife, gender equity, racial diversity… It’s about FAR more than a garden. There’s the history of western expansion in the US and Manifest Destiny. There’s the summer of 2020: the pandemic, outspoken activism, violence, wildfires.

In this seminal text, she asks us to witness her aims to diversify her garden, ""to make a bold, fresh way through seemingly pathless terrain."" She asks us to consider for ourselves the connection between diversifying nonhuman spaces and human spaces, and she does so through the lens of her lived experiences as an African American mother living in a predominantly white community in Colorado.

Dungy's memoir of her ""seven-year odyssey to diversify her garden in the predominantly white community of Fort Collins, Colorado."" Dungy and her family moved to Fort Collins in 2013 and found the community had ""restrictions about what residents could and could not plant' (front cover). Dungy resisted these ""homogeneous policies,"" in her garden--a garden of many native plants, of diversity, a garden that is planted in cooperation with its environment. This garden becomes a ""metaphor for how homogeneity threatens the future of our planet and why cultivating"" diversity and intersectionality, might just save us.                                      Her memoir, centered in her garden, in the earth where her plants grow, becomes a cri de coeur for environmental justice. Her memoir is a the story of the African Diasp0ra, and its connections to the land where African Americans had lived and still live. She writes of family and community, and it is both a personal history and a commentary of our nation's history that is fraught with injustice and racism. This is a story of resistance and a call for change--no, a cry from the heart for change.                                      Soil is beautiful and wise, and sometimes heartbreaking.

Within 300 pages, you are taken through a death-defying journey of the little-explored rapids of the Colorado river, you eddy at times over botanical descriptives and ecological backdrops before shoring up to learn more about the history of environmental science and the Grand Canyon National Park.                                      In 1938 Elzada Clover and Lois Jotter join four other men, across three boats, to journey 600 miles down the Colorado river in the hope of collecting and surveying its plant life. For the women, this trip was to provide an exciting opportunity to further their studies and contribute to the fast-evolving science of botany. The men too, each had their own agendas in making the trip. However, only one man, the expedition leader, had any sort of rafting experience. In fact, by 1938, there had only been about a dozen trips made, since it was first attempted some 70 years prior. That small handful of successful expeditions contained only men. When the rafting party set out, the media ran riot with harbingers of disaster and death and the complete foolhardiness of women being allowed at all, 'Women have their place in the world, but they do not belong in the Canyon of the Colorado'. Unfortunately, this dramatic publicity overshadowed and virtually dismissed the science that initiated the endeavour. It did not, however, preclude the two women from carefully documenting and collecting the plants; work which proved invaluable as future generations sought to redress the balance of the river's ecosystem. 'Before them, men...saw the river for what it could be, harnessed for human use. Clover and Jotter saw it as it was, a living system....'                                      Melissa Sevigny really brought this story to life with her descriptive and evocative language. A story that could have been bogged down with botanical, Latin names, is given context and life as we ride down the rapids and learn the history of the place. The grandiose achievement of Clover and Jotter being the first white women to have successfully journeyed down the Colorado river is nicely tempered with the value of their resulting scientific contribution. This book pleasantly surprised me and I'd recommend it to not just readers interested in science and botany but to anyone who enjoys women's non-fiction and their stories.

Brave The Wild River is the story of two women who mapped the botany of the Grand Canyon. In 1938 Elzada Clover and Lois Jotter set off on an expedition down the Colorado River with three male boatmen and their leader. The Colorado River was the most dangerous river in America and only a few people had ever attempted the rapids. No one had yet surveyed the plants in the Grand Canyon and the two botanists wanted to be the first. It was a very important but dangerous job.                                      Their story is exciting, interesting, and informative. Within the first few pages I had already learned a lot. Botany was considered a girly science, yet women didn't hold high-ranking jobs. Collecting plants while out for a stroll was nice but white water rafting was dangerous and incomprehensible. These women had to deal with a lot just to live their dream.                                      And then there was the river. I felt like I was right there with them. The descriptions of the river and Grand Canyon are so beautiful and well done. You can imagine how everyone felt on the 43 day journey. This story is well researched and well written. We get the history of the river, the native people who originally lived there, and how everything changed when people came with money and big plans.                                      If you are interested in nature, the Grand Canyon, exploring, or women's stories then you will like this. I highly recommend it. It's so interesting and fun to read.

I appreciate the details and use of photography that was taken during the time of the trip. For sure a book that a wide range of people would enjoy reading.

A fantastic narrative nonfiction about Clover and Jotter, two botanists in the 1930s that desired to to catalog all the plans of the Colorado River(flows through the Grand Canyon) at the time it was incredibly dangerous River with rapids and shifting landscape that many had died on. In fact no women had ever survived it. These ladies were the first but most importantly their work paved the way for botany of that region for generations to come and laid the way for a river and area that was constantly changing with our human hampering of dams and and such. I learned so much and found their story fascinating—- though they were often called out more for their gender than their work, these ladies did the work (so much work!!) and did so much for the world of science… also they just loved it. It was just the right length and though I knew nothing about this river or most of these plants( since I do not live in the south west) i was hooked and definitely recommend.","304 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 23, 2023","In the summer of 1938, botanists Elzada Clover and Lois Jotter set off down the Colorado River, accompanied by an ambitious expedition leader and three amateur boatmen.

Fedarko's storytelling has even inspired me to make my own trip down the Colorado River in the next few years!

On paper, this is exactly the kind of nonfiction book I'd enjoy - nature writing, national park history, an adventure story, women in STEM - but unfortunately there was something about Sevigny's storytelling that wasn't as gripping as I hoped it would be. Usually I love local histories and side topics, but for some reason their addition in                                       Brave the Wild River                                      only slowed down the (already slow) plot.

Sevigny shares the untold history of two women: Elzada Clover, a botanist at the University of Michigan, and Lois Jotter, a botany graduate student also at the University of Michigan, who in 1938 rafted over 600 miles down the Green and Colorado Rivers to Lake Mead, passing through the Grand Canyon along the way, to research, record, and map the botany of the area. The trip took Lois and Elzada and their river guides 43 days through harrowing rapids, heat, difficult terrain, and clashing personalities. They made their trip before the Glen Canyon Dam was built.                                      Meticulously researched and written like an adventure novel with page-turning prose, Sevigny's work deftly weaves the women's stories and discoveries that influenced botany for decades as well as other themes, like the sexism Lois and Elzada faced and how prescient they were about environmental issues, water and land use with which we continue to grapple today.                                      These two scientists were courageous pioneers in their field and their story is well worth reading. Elzada and Lois ""valued their curiosity about the world more than their presumed place within it.

Part mad-cap adventure story, part nature writing, and part side eye at the many sexist comments made before and during the expedition (mostly by newspaperMEN looking to sell a story…), I really enjoyed this story of rafting down the river as well as their journeys into academia. There were a few sections that dragged for me, but overall a great read, especially for anyone going to the GC or other national parks this summer.                                      I am not super well versed in this, but there are also a lot of references to the effect of humans on the environment, including climate change, as well as lack of inquiry to the native populations from these areas. As the Colorado River is experiencing some droughts and nearby states are being asked to ration, and of course as stories of the erasure of native peoples, ideas and knowledge continue to surface, I can’t help but think what today’s knowledge could have done to change things back in 1938 (or even 50 years ago…)","304 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 23, 2023","In the summer of 1938, botanists Elzada Clover and Lois Jotter set off down the Colorado River, accompanied by an ambitious expedition leader and three amateur boatmen.

This book is really well done, and paints a vivid picture of the expedition. It is not at all bogged down with unnecessary details.

Thanks to @booksparks for the gifted Arc #springpopup ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️                                      Tuni spends her life coping with childhood trauma; a sexually abusive father and a mother who didn’t stop him. After a life-changing accident, she begins a journey to find peace.                                      This was a deeply emotional and revealing memoir. Be ready to dive deep with this one. It is poetic and very meaningful with its words. It shows the reader trauma and how impactful trauma can be, as well as the healing process.                                      “Because trauma is cellularly communal, biologically universal, trauma is a shared experience, literally and invisible. It penetrates blood and bones just like music; it infests the air we breathe and the words we speak.”                                      The Underwater Daughter comes out 5/2.","272 pages, Paperback                             First published May 2, 2023","Tuni’s father began sexually abusing her when she was just four years old. Her mother, though aware of the abuse, was a silent witness—one either incapable or unwilling to intervene—and the abuse continued until Tuni was eleven. Three years later, when Tuni was fourteen, she was raped by an adult actor who was part of her cast in a professional theater production. These traumas would go on to shape much of her life.                              Underwater Daughter follows how Tuni grappled with her relationship with her parents, the aftermath of her rape, an eating disorder, drug and alcohol excesses, and shame as she came of age and began to build a life. In order to not lose her inner innocence, in order to protect herself, in order to believe in love, she began early on to create imaginary worlds into which she could escape—to use dreams to transport her away from her fears. By early adulthood, she was well practiced at slapping lipstick (pink, frosty, kiss-me, gloss-over, perfect lipstick) over whatever darkness might be bubbling beneath. Hired by a dance company right out of high school, she found success as a dancer in Chicago and New York, but in her personal and emotional life, she continued to struggle. Ultimately, it took her decades of dancing, hiding, faking, fucking, costuming, implanting, dissociating, marrying, divorcing, and purging—all while staying silent about her past trauma—before a bike accident at age fifty-five forced her to stop and truly take stock of her life. As she did, she came to a resting place, finally, in regard to her father; developed the loving relationship she’d always wanted with her mother; and came to understand that, in the end, love is all anyone wants—or needs."

Reading about her trauma, so deeply folded into the nuances and dealings of the family, undoubtedly had me reflecting on my own experiences with abuse.                                      ""I was not a natural swimmer, but with fierce determination                                      I became one."" - Underwater Daughter                                      My mother has a burgeoning, fiery gift with words. Relinquishing them wasn't a choice; in reading her story it's obvious that her life depended on it. An avid lover of reading myself, it is with so much pride that I note the unique prose-like whimsy with which Tuni writes about the most painful of experiences, painting cruel, but beautiful scenes of abuse, betrayal, violence, and revelation.                                      ""Victims narrating their experiences, externalizing what they have internalized are engaging in a sacred cleanse, a painful purging of truth; listen...                                      They will remember what they saw behind their squeezed eyelids. They will remember the taste of the acid rising into the backs of their throats, the pain pressuring into their skulls, the color of the wood framing the door, the time travel, the day of the week, the color of the sheet, the taste of their own tongues, the blood, the dying..."" - Underwater Daughter                                      I recently read The Book of Laughter and Forgetting by Milan Kundera, and as may be true of many books I read now that I've ventured into the world of Tuni Deignan, I constantly kept thinking of her experience as a writer throughout. Two specific quotes/concepts come to mind:                                      “By writing books, a man turns into a universe.” In Kundera's words, this is exactly how it feels to read Tuni's memoir. The words lift you from your seat, surround you with light-tipped fingers, and show you the confusing world of a woman lost in herself and her pain.                                      The concept of Litost is devoted an entire chapter in Laughter and Forgetting; funny enough, it is also the name of a song that Mom and I loved for years (she'll know the one). I never really knew what the word meant then, but Kundera illuminates that ""it designates a feeling as infinite as an open accordion, a feeling that is the synthesis of many others: grief, sympathy, remorse, and an indefinable longing. The first syllable, which is long and stressed, sounds like the wail of an abandoned dog... Litost is a state of torment caused by a sudden insight into one's own miserable self."" In more ways than one (see the litany of dogs loved deeply by my mother over the years), Tuni is familiar with the concept intimately. I wonder now if our hearts were telling us something when we turned to that song all those years ago.                                      ""In the face of someone I loved becoming undone, I turned away, cowardly. I put myself first and moved on, thus denying the possibility of love's guidance... and for this, I plead forgiveness"" - Underwater Daughter                                      Mom's story is greatly entwined with litost, addressing her own and acknowledging the prolific nature of the feeling throughout family dynamics. As the cause of so much pain in her life and in the lives of those she holds closest. In the lives of those whom she feels she must hold close to survive. I would argue that the physical feeling itself aligns well to that of the infinite pressure of water on desperate lungs.                                      ""In reflection, I've thought about the what ifs - have you? ... Habitually, I return to a fish, a fish, and a fish, slippery and rippley, qwerky-ing into pockets of channeled rivers, engorged in briny fortune and unfettered flow. The underwater underworld where my body is buffered, cool, fast, and unholdable.                                      What if."" - Underwater Daughter                                      ""It is one of the ornaments of youth,"" says Kundera, ""first comes a feeling of torment, then the desire for revenge."" This is the essence of what my Mum deals with in processing her story; how to reconcile, how to move past, how to forgive otherwise unforgivable truths despite the feral need for retribution, reconciliation, revenge. In this way, her memoir is relatable, and useful, for all.                                      ""So, if I love you, but you fear, what then? And if you love me, but I fear, what next?...                                      My hope is when we meet and I place my love in the lead you will do the same. As you lean in toward me and offer your love forward first, can we meet there, love on love, and leave fear behind?"" - Underwater Daughter                                      I am grateful for this book.

Deignan's story is written to pull you under, into the waters of her life, starting with a childhood fraught with risk and shame and then moving along through cities, through traumas and triumphs, through the years.                                      It's a lot of story—enough so that Deignan could have opted to write it into multiple separate books, had she chosen. But thematically: trauma in body and trauma in mind; unexpected healings; being, through the thick and the thin of it, her mother's daughter to the end. Its scope is sweeping, spanning decades, sometimes diving in deep and sometimes skimming the surface. Dance and body image and sexual violence and career-changing injuries and death, building a spider's web of connections.                                       ""I'm sorry,"" she never said to me.

(loc. 504*)                                      Deignan writes with the sensibilities of someone who has taken a lot of writing classes—this would have fit right in at my MFA program, and at times I wondered whether certain sections had started out as essays and been submitted to lit journals before being folded into                                       Underwater Daughter                                      . It's a style that can be polarizing, I think—this is for readers who like literary fiction, and stories that are not all told at once but rather fragment and twist and circle back to themselves, and a lot of questions without answers to match.

Her mother, though aware of the abuse, was a silent witness—one either incapable or unwilling to intervene—and the abuse continued until Tuni was eleven.

Hired by a dance company right out of high school, she found success as a dancer in Chicago and New York, but in her personal and emotional life, she continued to struggle. Ultimately, it took her decades of dancing, hiding, faking, fucking, costuming, implanting, dissociating, marrying, divorcing, and purging—all while staying silent about her past trauma—before a bike accident at age fifty-five forced her to stop and truly take stock of her life. As she did, she came to a resting place, finally, in regard to her father; developed the loving relationship she’d always wanted with her mother; and came to understand that, in the end, love is all anyone wants—or needs."

In reading UD it feels appropriate to let go of a straightforward narrative and go along with the flow of Tuni’s almost lyrical writing style. The story flows back and forth through her life like waves, if you try to apply a strict chronology you will only fail to grasp how interrelated all of life’s experiences end up. She never preaches, she shares, and opens the reader’s eyes to her world of abuse, dance, pain, love and acceptance. Her writing is compelling and filled with her artistry, and while wrenching at times it is an amazing success story.","272 pages, Paperback                             First published May 2, 2023","Tuni’s father began sexually abusing her when she was just four years old.

Somehow, it is also still beautiful.                                      -it is a kaleidoscope of formats: poetry, quotes, essays... all woven together in a patchwork quilt.                                      -I want to hold my breath so the unthinkable horrors stop. Maybe if I hold my breath, it won't happen anymore.                                      -the juxtaposition between how beautiful the writing is and the events that occurred is frightening... and well done (also unthinkably sad that these events took place to contrast against).                                      -what a horrible ""solution"" to an unthinkable act.

An extremely powerful first book.                                      *She is a new writer                                      *She is descriptive                                      The intriguing and appropriately titled Underwater Daughter opens the story where this buoyant journey begins to flow like a poem and where we learn from the author her memoir of survival and healing. She milks our emotions time and time again as she shares several selected focal points along the way.                                      *She is buoyant                                      *She is a survivor                                      *She is a teacher                                      Early age sex abuse, secrets and escapism predicate the foundation of Tuni’s coping mechanisms and build from there. It’s a wild ride of excitement coupled with sometimes errant naiveté and nondisclosure during a hush hush era that add a lot of momentum and fuel to an already explosive story. The subject matter is harsh at times and varies depending on the highlighted point, but the writing is eloquent and grabbing thus allowing the reader to be more enlightened and grateful for these hard to read down-to-earth truths.                                      *She is a victim                                      *She is naïve                                      *She is eloquent                                      *She is down to earth                                      Everyone can learn from Underwater Daughter. Beautifully written, it shows grit and tenacity beyond the darkness and grows humor, joy, love, grace, humility, and bravery at each story point. It’s a wonderful reminder that out of bad comes good and out of dark comes light inspiring us all to remember that in our own personal journey going forward.                                      *She is gritty                                      *She is tenacious                                      *She is humble                                      *She is brave                                      *She is inspiring                                      So, pull on your go-go boots, grab a buoy, hold your breath, and hang on for a fantastically unfathomable story of harsh reality, forgiveness, joy, love, and discovery.

The title is apt for a number of reasons. Like water, at times, words spill and flow gently—at others, they fall hard, shocking and roiling the reader. Moreover, time and space are fluid; events are not presented chronologically, and the author moves between memories as lived in the moment and reflections on those events as processed and interpreted later. With incredible courage, Deignan invites us to be not only eye-witnesses to her life, but also to experience events on multiple sensory levels, finding ourselves with her as a fourteen-year-old in her twenty-two- year-old co-star’s apartment, unable to speak the words so many women have had silenced in their throats; as a young woman, dancing as a Studio 54 go-go girl, glittering and curling above guests dancing below; weeks later sitting between her parents in a therapist’s office, waiting to hear words from them that do not come; as a fifty-five-year-old at the sink in her bathroom, using her tongue to retrieve pain medication from tiny Indian brass bowls after a bike accident renders her arms useless: and so many others.

Underwater Daughter follows how Tuni grappled with her relationship with her parents, the aftermath of her rape, an eating disorder, drug and alcohol excesses, and shame as she came of age and began to build a life. In order to not lose her inner innocence, in order to protect herself, in order to believe in love, she began early on to create imaginary worlds into which she could escape—to use dreams to transport her away from her fears. By early adulthood, she was well practiced at slapping lipstick (pink, frosty, kiss-me, gloss-over, perfect lipstick) over whatever darkness might be bubbling beneath. Hired by a dance company right out of high school, she found success as a dancer in Chicago and New York, but in her personal and emotional life, she continued to struggle. Ultimately, it took her decades of dancing, hiding, faking, fucking, costuming, implanting, dissociating, marrying, divorcing, and purging—all while staying silent about her past trauma—before a bike accident at age fifty-five forced her to stop and truly take stock of her life. As she did, she came to a resting place, finally, in regard to her father; developed the loving relationship she’d always wanted with her mother; and came to understand that, in the end, love is all anyone wants—or needs."

After a devastating accident forced Deignan to lie still and reflect on her past, she turned to writing as a means of therapy and release. She recalls her children, her marriages, her career as a dancer, struggles with eating disorders and substance abuse, and reaches back into cheerless childhood memories of her father’s sexual violations and her mother’s refusal to stop or acknowledge it. The journey is not linear, but rather one comprised of snapshots, fleeting windows peering into singular moments of impact. Her world is a darkly painted reverie, held together by images of the sea. It is difficult to say what makes a book feel important, exactly, but Deignan’s words cry out to be heard, her prose blazing across the pages. When the writing becomes repetitive or fragmented, it reads as honest, a stream-of-consciousness bleeding freely onto the paper. She doesn’t shy away from visceral darkness, but instead submerges your senses inside the gritty realities. A poetic reflection upon a life of toil and the challenges of forgiveness, this memoir is a triumphant reclamation of self for Deignan, and a celebration of resilience.                                      As might be expected, this book contains a lot of content that may be triggering to those who have suffered abuse, suicidal thoughts, or struggled with substance abuse, so please keep that in mind before reading.","272 pages, Paperback                             First published May 2, 2023","Tuni’s father began sexually abusing her when she was just four years old.

I will admit as a mom, parts of this were very hard to read, both from her personal experiences of molestation and rape and who the perpetrators were. Her story will tear you apart, have you wanting to rage and beat walls, but it will also inspire you with her strength and ability to love so deeply despite what she has been through. Her writing is beautifully sprinkled with lyrical prose that captivates her feelings in such a way I felt it all with her. I am always in awe when someone is so willing to open up their personal experiences and feelings for the world to read but it is so necessary sometimes to read someone else’s story to help learn from it and adapt it to our own lives. I don’t like giving star ratings to memoirs. This is someone’s personal story of trauma, healing, and love. I don’t have the right to rate someone’s life or their pain. However, this really is a 5 star read and I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a memoir to read. While heart wrenching and painful, it is also beautifully written and very inspiring.","272 pages, Paperback                             First published May 2, 2023","Tuni’s father began sexually abusing her when she was just four years old.

It reads like a series of short stories that aren’t in chronological order. Tuni’s life is marked by a series of trauma and tragedies, beginning with her childhood. The remarkable thing about the way this is written is that it gives you the sense that she is at peace, and at this point in her life, hasn’t let any one single event define her.                                      Please be warned that at the heart of this journey is the trauma of having a sexually abusive father at a very young age, and a mother who is either unwilling or unable to stop him.                                      The collection of short passages about her life jump around between childhood, adolescence, young adulthood and older adulthood. Each part of her life contains a different trauma that she has had to cope with, adapt to, and overcome.

Tuni was sexually abused as a child by her father while her mother did nothing to stop it. She then experienced sexual assault as a teenager. Tuni became an accomplished dancer, dance teacher, wife and mother. It took many years before Tuni was able to recognize that what happened to her was not normal, that what she experienced was trauma, and that she was not protected by those who should have ensured her safety. Tuni's incredible inner strength shines through in her lyrical, poetic story of survival and healing.

The author has a way with words, she speaks of her trauma and her healing process and allows readers to understand on a more deeper level. In this book, I read trauma, joy, love, humor, and strength. Deignan has written a powerful and compelling book.                                      I always say how memoirs are still so new to me, but I can easily see why reading about people’s lives is so important. Reading about Deignan’s life has shown me that we all have a journey to experience, no matter the circumstances. We can face anything and ride the waves.","272 pages, Paperback                             First published May 2, 2023","Tuni’s father began sexually abusing her when she was just four years old.

It’s an excellent bridge between personal essays and more academic looks at the different topics throughout the book.                                       The Male Gazed                                      is about the ways that the media portrays masculinity and homoeroticism and how that impacts the ways that men, especially gay men, think about themselves and others. There were so many pieces of media being analyzed here that I personally haven’t read about before. Or even when it was a topic like Disney movies, the angle was different than what most pieces of pop culture criticism focus on.                                      Manuel Betancourt grew up in Colombia, so it was interesting to see his perspective on US media. I also enjoyed being introduced to TV shows, figures, or concepts that I hadn’t heard of before. A telenovela from the mid-90s called                                       Hombres                                      was the focus of one chapter, and through Betancourt’s description of the show and analysis it was easy to understand the landscape when it came to masculinity in Colombia as he was growing up.                                      I really love books where people dive deep into the media that had a big impact on them, especially when it relates to sexuality.                                       The Male Gazed                                      covers so much ground, from                                       Saved by the Bell                                      , anime, Pedro Almodóvar, Ricky Martin, Walter Mercado, wrestling singlets, to so much more. I’d definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a blend of memoir and pop culture criticism that skews a bit more scholarly.

Looking back over decades’ worth of pop culture’s attempts to codify and reframe what men can be, wear, do, and desire, this book establishes that to gaze at men is still a subversive act.

Manuel Betancourt’s THE MALE GAZED presents cultural criticism in a format I deeply appreciate: accessible, jargon-free (or explained), personal, and relatable. Reading THE MALE GAZED felt like having a coffee chat with an immensely smart friend who is at a transcendent level of self-awareness and would happily answer any question you have. From Disney buffs to telenovela men, sculpted anime bodies to Channing Tatum’s ass, Betancourt strips down (har har) cultural thirst traps and moments in film and television to reveal what they say about eroticism, homosexuality, performance, societal expectations, and the relationship between the gazers and the gazed-s—as well as how they tie into Betancourt’s own experiences of queerness. We’re brought directly into moments where queerness emerged in between or discreetly despite “expectations” of straightness or an implied (straight) feminine audience: openings filled with possibilities of queer desire. This may be beyond the scope of THE MALE GAZED, but by the end, I was left wondering about desire that overtly opposes not just the straightness of gaze and the desirability of the gazers, but the idealized, toned, hunky bodies of the gazed themselves.                                      Favorite essay of mine from this book: definitely “Once Upon a Dream” on showing me Disney animated movies in a different light (seriously, now I can’t help but think about how King Triton was a total silver-haired stud).

He provides no evidence that the movies he discusses were seen by more people than other movies, or that the books he discusses were read by more people than other movies. There's no evidence that after a certain work was released, that field changed in a measurable way. So, I don't think he chose these texts for their impact on culture at large. Instead, I think he chose them for their impact on him. Yet he also doesn't provide evidence of that! He doesn't include anecdotes from his life in enough detail to show the concrete consequences of these works on his life. So what we're left with is just that Betancourt felt like writing about these works and for some reason Catapult decided to publish his musings. It's like he just wanted to talk about his favorite books, movies, and TV shows, and he used an academic approach to justify it. But he included the worst of academic writing, namely, a convoluted, flowery style that obfuscates what he's trying to say. This book leaves out the best of academic writing: clarity, logic, structure, citations, a direct question and a rigorous answer.","208 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","Featuring deep dives into thirst traps, drag queens, Antonio Banderas, and telenovelas—all in the service of helping us reframe how we talk about (desiring) men—this insightful memoir-in-essays is as much a coming of age as a coming out book                              Manuel Betancourt has long lustfully coveted masculinity—in part because he so lacked it.

I’ll start with the few good parts of this book: some interesting historical insights (Disney characters designed by gay men, Ricky Martin before he became famous in the United States) and the author’s own journey is certainly valid.

It’s an extremely generous book — Key shares with the reader her own personal experiences as a woman who, while having an abundance of platonic and familial love in her life, has had a lack of romantic love. Rather than try to make it into some kind of parable about being happy with what you have or not needing a man, she acknowledges that she still feels a lack in her life and wants romantic love. That honesty is what makes this a really insightful read, and I think even if you are the kind of person who is always in a romantic relationship this book can go some way towards helping you understand why that might be and your own relationship with romantic love.                                      I think this book will do for single women what Sheila Heti’s motherhood did for those who are ambivalent about having children — in giving them a voice it creates a validating solidarity, and encourages those who read it to reevaluate their treatment/assumptions of the people in their lives who live alone.                                      I love the richness in the way Key perceives life, with a poet’s love of details — I especially enjoyed the writing about holidaying alone. Despite covering some very sad topics, it is still a joyful book with a lot of love in it. At times it made me unexpectedly snort with laughter.                                      Highly recommend.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","When poet Amy Key was growing up, she looked forward to a life shaped by romance, fuelled by desire, longing and the conventional markers of success that come when you share a life with another person. But that didn't happen for her. Now in her forties, she sets out to explore the realities of a life lived in the absence of romantic love.                              Using Joni Mitchell's seminal album                               Blue                              - an album that shaped Key's expectations of love - as her guide, she examines the unexpected life she has created for herself. Building a home, travelling alone, choosing whether to be a mother, recognising her own milestones, learning the limits of self-care and the expansive potential of self-friendship, Key uncovers the many forms of connection and care that often go unnoticed.                              With profound candour and intimacy,                               Arrangements in Blue                              explores the painful feelings we are usually too ashamed to discuss: loneliness, envy, grief and failure.

The dream songs I’ve written to Blue’s arrangements.” Amy Key’s debut memoir, Arrangements in Blue, is a book in many ways about Joni Mitchell’s most essential album, Blue — about how the album set up a kind of world-view for Key around the subject of romantic love. But this book is also so like that album — in its compassionate ability to comfort, its starkly evident gorgeousness, and its courageous, mutually liberating confessional tone; Kris Kristofferson famously told Mitchell to “save something for yourself”, but Blue endures because she would not listen. I am so grateful to Key for taking up the mantle. This personal story of a life lived in the absence of romantic love, lived by and for oneself, contains within it deep reflections of more universal concerns: there’s a compounding of loneliness (alone even in one’s aloneness), the shame of being perceived as unloveable because of it, the struggle of seeing oneself without another person to read us into being. Key discusses homebuilding and solo travels, family-rearing and financial constraints, all the (im)practicalities of living in a world built for and around couples; but also craft, the soul, the magnitude of platonic love from friendships and family, and the deeper costs of — and the joy to be found in — finding a way forward alone. The ten chapters serve as a kind of personal and literary track-by-track, using the ten songs from Joni’s album as lyrical lenses to look at intersecting ideas and life events. I have my own personal reasons for needing and loving a book like this, but I believe wholly in its power to be redemptive for those of us trying to embrace a life with its own hierarchy of love and meaning.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","When poet Amy Key was growing up, she looked forward to a life shaped by romance, fuelled by desire, longing and the conventional markers of success that come when you share a life with another person.

You don't have to be single to relate to Amy Key's words and sentiments - she digs deep into the human heart and speaks eloquently for so many of us. That said, I felt such a kinship with her words, felt that she had peeked into my emotional makeup and laid out a map of its landscape for all to see, down to her love of the water and the sea.. Each essay in this collection is carefully arranged, building on and informing the other, creating a crescendo of longing and desire, heartache and heartful, beautifully capturing our need for connection, for intimacy, for love.

I read one of amy key's essays a year or two ago and felt myself reflected in her words. a lot has changed since then, but i still found this book resonating so strongly with me. i listened to it on audiobook (read beautifully by key herself) and felt a pang when I saw there was only an hour and a half left. several parts of the book, particularly the later chapters brought tears to my eyes. i hate describing women who write honestly about their lives as brave, but i do think key is brave to write so openly about her experiences of being single and the journey her life has taken. key takes a topic so many people feel deep shame and self-doubt about (including myself at times earlier in my life!) and shows her vulnerability and strength throughout the book.                                      the book is a very poignant and beautiful account of a life lived in most part without romantic relationships and in conversation with joni mitchell's blue album. key doesn't arrive at a neat answer about single life or declare that she doesn't and will never need a romantic partner, but instead honestly explores what it's like not have periods of your life defined by romantic love. life isn't empty of purpose or meaning without a significant other, but key is honest about the drawbacks and difficulties in doing so and doesn't shy away from uncomfortable conclusions or unflattering descriptions of her own experiences.                                      key's prose is luminous and poetic throughout the book, but it particularly shines in the later chapters. i loved the ""crazy"" chapter detailing her experiences with men which lasted months and years but never fell under the placeholder of ""partner/boyfriend"" and found it very relatable. key's candour about these relationships (because yes! you are allowed to call them relationships) is so refreshing - i often feel women are pressured into diminishing the impact of the people who treat us badly, especially if this happens outside the limits of a clearly defined romantic partnership. her description of caring for her friend and mentor roddy lumsden through his illness and eventually mourning him after his death is painfully honest but shot through with such tenderness that i nearly cried listening to it. and the final chapter is a beautiful end to the book, with such warm and hopeful reflections on human connection and care outside and within romantic love.                                      key's writing is gorgeous throughout the book. her handling of singleness, connection and romance is so nuanced and generous. i also really enjoyed the connecting thread of joni mitchell and the blue album. this is probably my favourite book i've read so far this year and i'll be looking out eagerly for any more writing by amy key in the future.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","When poet Amy Key was growing up, she looked forward to a life shaped by romance, fuelled by desire, longing and the conventional markers of success that come when you share a life with another person.

It is intricately examined under her personal microscope.                                      At first I enjoyed her writing, reflections and unflinching analysis. However it is analysis that I found to be the problem for me. It felt like an endless, repetitive stream of consciousness, as if in the psychiatrist's chair. I think an essay format would have contained the insights more succinctly. Paralleling her life with Joni Mitchell's ""Blue"" felt an unnecessarily contrived peg for her waves of vulnerability to hang upon.                                      I think if I had read this as a younger woman, I would have lapped up the intensity but aged 60+ I kept trying immersion but was actually quite irritated. She has a rich seam of friendships and, despite one of them being tragic, this is how life is and for me, it was just too indulgent.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","When poet Amy Key was growing up, she looked forward to a life shaped by romance, fuelled by desire, longing and the conventional markers of success that come when you share a life with another person.

As a fan of Amy’s lush and evocative poetry, I eagerly anticipated her book, and it was nothing short of astonishing.                                      Key weaves her personal journey with her deep connection to the songs on Joni Mitchell's “Blue” album. She reflects on her teenage years, when the album became “her” soundtrack. As time passed and romantic love eluded her, Amy reflected deeply on Mitchell’s lyrics, finding a kindred spirit.                                      What makes “Arrangements in Blue” so powerful is Key's vulnerability and candidness. She explores themes of loneliness, desire, jealousy, regret, friendship, and self-realization with rare integrity and courage.                                      Throughout the memoir, Key celebrates the many forms of intimacy that often go unnoticed, offering a tender and philosophical perspective on living life on one's own terms. She encourages readers to find ways to romanticize their own lives, whether through small gestures like buying fresh flowers or taking solo trips, ultimately emphasizing the importance of self-discovery and self-friendship.                                      This does not alleviate her yearning for romantic love and being part of a couple, but her contemplations also reveal the abundance in her life, particularly her family of cats and friends, and the joy she finds in her home. Particularly poignant are Key’s musings about her close and complicated friendship with British poet and mentor, Roddy Lumsden, who passed away in 2020.                                      Key's memoir captivates from beginning to end. I listened to the audiobook with great admiration. “Arrangements in Blue” is a must-read/listen for anyone seeking a broader emotional palette beyond the confines of traditional romance. Amy Key is an extraordinary writer and I believe her memoir will become a classic for future generations.                                      *                                      Thank you you to Dreamscape Media 🎧 and NetGalley for the opportunity to listen to “Arrangements in Blue”.

I have so much respect and appreciation to the way Amy Key allowed the reader to get such a large piece of her heart and mind in this memoir. I thought this was such a refreshing take on longing, loneliness, and negotiating your own version of adulthood between what you desire, what you should desire, and the idea of the nuclear family and romantic companionship.                                      I also loved the way all these conversations were centered around this one album that defined so much of Key's life, and found that to be such a clever way of approaching both her life experience and these broader themes.

There are a few more tangential chapters: making a home and going on holiday might be different when undertaken alone, but are not central to the experience of being single to me (anymore). As a result, it feels like she's sometimes too hung up on her status as a single woman, as if every single aspect of life revolves around relationship status. It doesn't and it shouldn't, but I can imagine it feels like that for some people or sometimes.

Its absence creates a real pain, but I’ve come to understand some of that pain is generated by an assumption that people are watching my aloneness, people are judging it, pitying it. I told myself life was withholding from me all the things I connected to romantic love. But it wasn’t.                                      This memoir uses Joni Mitchell’s iconic album                                       Blue                                      as a way of exploring the author’s own feelings about romantic love and the way its presence, and mostly its absence, has shaped her life, her self-understanding and her own art. A review of this book - and an interview with its author, Amy Key - snagged my attention because I, too, have loved Joni Mitchell’s album                                       Blue                                      for many, many years and it has been a sort of touchstone for me, or at least a collection of music that has never lost its brilliance and its ability to move me. More than this, though, I was intrigued by the idea of a memoir by a 44 year old writer who has mostly lived without romantic love. As she writes in the book’s dedication, she offers up her own story “for anyone who needs a love story of being alone.”                                      Key has never married or even lived with a lover; she has not had children. She has not had the comfort, ever, of a steady, long-term romantic partner. She writes about these things with some regret but mostly just honesty. This is most definitely not a manifesto about how the single life is the best life, or even the life she would have chosen for herself. Key very bravely admits that she would rather have found a romantic partner - and still hopes for it - but the majority of this book is a sort of ‘coming to terms’ (or even making terms) with a romantically single life filled with other people and other passions.                                       The more I’ve listened to what she says in                                         Blue’s                                        songs, the more comforted I am by my own messy desires. The way I’ve hated some and loved some. My need for retreat and escape, the way I weave back and forth between apparently contradictory or parallel feelings, creating a cocoon of indecision.                                         I hear this ambivalence all throughout Blue.                                       Key is honest, sometimes brutally so, about her negative experiences with romantic love and her unrequited yearnings, but she also questions how much of the pain of eluded love has more to do with conventional expectations than an actual lack. I have two daughters in their 20s and a good number of their female friends have never had romantic partners. It worries them on various levels, and as the years go by, they cannot help but wonder if finding love is ever going to happen for them. Does one refer to it as ‘condition’ or a ‘situation’ or something else? Whatever, it seems to be coming more commonplace; and if it becomes more common to be alone, no doubt it will also become more acceptable. And yet Key notes the desire for human connection is strong, and not easily quelled by rationalisation and making the best of things.                                      The author’s observations about romantic love range widely and can sometimes edge into self-pitying laments, although she tries to avoid that particular key. She doesn’t downplay the soul-corrosive aspect of loneliness, though, and her descriptions of her long friendship with poet Roddy Lumsden touch movingly on how lack of love can warp a person’s life, even if it is rich with art and friendship. It’s not loneliness per se, but it is a kind of loneliness.                                      This is not a book for those who disdain or even use the term “navel gazing,” but I appreciated Key’s honesty and observations. I have a feeling that there will be a good number of readers who find an emotional guide in Amy Key’s experiences - “metabolised into art” - just as she found one in Joni Mitchell’s music.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","When poet Amy Key was growing up, she looked forward to a life shaped by romance, fuelled by desire, longing and the conventional markers of success that come when you share a life with another person.

As such, it speaks deeply to any of us who have been through, or are living, a similar life experience. Even if we haven't arrived at the same current destination as she has.                                      Following Joni Mitchell's iconic album, Key's essays dive into moments and feelings of inadequacy as well as those moments when she realizes there are not inadequacies in her so much as in how we as a society perceive life to be for a single person. I used to be one of those that seemed to be as much in love with the idea of being in love as with the actual people I loved. As several relationships faltered, I came to the realization that intimacy is not confined to either romance or the physical acts we so often mistakenly call making love. Devoid of any feeling for the other person they are definitely empty, desperate acts, but the feelings don't have to be a claiming as in most romantic relationships.                                      I found Key's honesty in looking at both herself and at the society within which she lives refreshing. Like most of us can relate to, there is far less certainty and far more questioning in our daily lives than we want to admit, even (perhaps especially?) in our romantic relationships. The facade of certainty is often what allows us to keep playing the game even if we don't want to. For those fortunate enough to want to play and to have found their ideal (or close enough) partner, it can be wonderful. But that doesn't mean that is or should be the goal for everyone, we are all different. Now if only society would stop implying there must be a defect in anyone who is single for any length of time, or, God forbid, by choice long term.                                      I fluctuated between taking in these ""notes"" as memoirish work that has me inhabiting Key's life vicariously and as thought pieces that use personal anecdotes to drive home the ideas. So I spent some time thinking about how she might have felt during some of these periods and some time reflecting on my own life and beliefs. This worked very well for me, I didn't feel alone while working through my personal feelings and felt care for her while she worked through hers.                                      This is not going to feel the same for every reader, even more so than most books. Some will get defensive when they recognize themselves and lash out, some will only see whining where I see trying to understand oneself. But for those who connect with attempts to understand one's life, this will largely be a very well-written success.

It ponders whether we can rid ourselves of the underlying expectation of needing romantic love to have lived a “complete” life.                                      I took my time reading this collection, dipping in and out of it chapter by chapter. Allowing myself to pause and sit with each section I read. I could see so much of my younger self in Key’s experiences with romance, the tethering of selfhood and worth to whether or not I had a romantic partner. The cycle of creating an idea of a person, becoming enamored with it, and subsequently being heartbroken when the reality doesn’t align - or shatters in front of you.                                      The essays incorporate scenes from the author’s life, with Key looking back at the landscape of her romantic self and how her outlook on romance was shaped by the lyrics of Joni Mitchell’s album, Blue. Over the course of the collection, we see Key grappling with a world that is often catered to couples, and the journey she’s had in finding and establishing herself and the life she wants to live - regardless of whether or not she has a romantic partner.                                      The theme of loneliness is often touched on and returned to in this collection. Key contends with loneliness, whether it be in the aftermath of a breakup, having the realization that every adult in her life has “found their person”, looking at how her personal relationships have shifted as friends get married and have kids, or even just the absence of a theoretical romantic partner. The impact these things have had, and how they’ve shaped her. I read The Lonely City by Olivia Laing earlier this year, and this collection felt like an extension of the conversation Laing’s book was having about loneliness. However, Arrangements in Blue explored this theme on a much more intimate and one-to-one level, over the course of a life.                                      This collection is poignant and raw, gorgeously written, and intimately vulnerable. Amy Key takes us through the highs and lows, the reflections, and the milestones that have made up her adult life. As a reader, I saw parts of myself in Amy and her experience, and have since been able to look back with a deeper level of understanding and kindness on certain times in my life.

When I came across Amy's memoir, I knew I had to read it. Not only the perspective of exploring love, a subject that is so familiar yet that seems so out of reach for me, was attractive, but also the fact that this theme was combined with Joni Mitchell's album BLUE sounded riveting. I already adore Joni's Blue in the sense that Joni is so honest in the feelings she pours in every song; I also found this in Amy's memoir. I thought it was extremely brave to broach some topics, such as indecisiveness toward getting a partner or not, having children or not, and Amy's relation to her sexuality. This in-betweenness was very relatable for me because it depicted quite nicely my own paradoxical feelings about wanting everything to stay the same (nurturing the comfort I spent so long to create and find) and wishing new things to mould you into a better version of yourself. It seemed particularly relevant when Amy writes about her home, about spending a long time sharing flats with people and about contemplating the moment she would be able to get her own space and do whatever she wants with it. I really related to this; it's a feeling that I thought a lot about recently. I was also very moved by her close connection with Roddy Lumsden.                                      All in all, I would strongly recommend this memoir to my readers. I believe that is a book that can be read by women of all ages, but as a young person I especially related to it and it brought back many discussions some of my friends and I had on (romantic) relationships nowadays. I think I'll particularly encourage people to listen to the audiobook because I feel that listening to Amy reading her own words brings something very special to the experience of reading her memoir.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","When poet Amy Key was growing up, she looked forward to a life shaped by romance, fuelled by desire, longing and the conventional markers of success that come when you share a life with another person.

Amy Key’s Arrangements in Blue is aptly titled after the colour and Joni Mitchell’s Blue album, yet Key uses both of these elements as a lens through which to view relationships. In essence, blue and its connotations of calmness, loyalty, and responsibility are what Key seeks in life but the experience of failed after failed relationship invites her to investigate the significance that society places on romantic love and moves beyond this ideal to explore other means to feel fulfilled in life, asking herself questions: What is a home? How can someone create a home of their own? Is parenthood for me? Do material possessions bring joy? Can people impact our lives? Are the expectations of romantic or even true love so essential to our journeys? Is inner peace achievable? In every chapter, Key revisits her younger self with great vulnerability to help the reader get a clearer sense of her mindset and her reasoning behind many of her life choices. This is a memoir that sets off to challenge romantic love’s promises only to conclude that people can proudly live life on one’s own terms in whatever form that may be.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","When poet Amy Key was growing up, she looked forward to a life shaped by romance, fuelled by desire, longing and the conventional markers of success that come when you share a life with another person.

This book is full of brutal, beautiful honesty and I’ll say it is rare I leave pages feeling so seen and understood. Writing a book this raw and authentic must not have been easy, but I am so thankful Key felt strong enough about it to let it into the world. Her words gently welcomed me to question parts of myself that I was too prideful to touch, and it was in those places I found an invitation to heal, to let go, to grow alongside her.

But that didn't happen for her. Now in her forties, she sets out to explore the realities of a life lived in the absence of romantic love.                              Using Joni Mitchell's seminal album                               Blue                              - an album that shaped Key's expectations of love - as her guide, she examines the unexpected life she has created for herself. Building a home, travelling alone, choosing whether to be a mother, recognising her own milestones, learning the limits of self-care and the expansive potential of self-friendship, Key uncovers the many forms of connection and care that often go unnoticed.                              With profound candour and intimacy,                               Arrangements in Blue                              explores the painful feelings we are usually too ashamed to discuss: loneliness, envy, grief and failure. The result is a singular work - a beautifully-written and essential book about building a life on your own terms, which inspires us to live and love more honestly."

It is mind boggling to believe that this is the same person. We bear witness to her successes and failures, her disappointments and triumphs, all relayed in a very matter of fact way; with sincerity and humility. Aurora James- I had never heard of her before I read this book but everyone must know her name. She is testament to the fact that “the world is our oyster” - we can achieve our dreams through sheer grit and determination, through building a community around us, and by immense humility. A fascinating memoir - I look forward to seeing what she will do next.","304 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","This extraordinary memoir of struggle and perseverance offers new ways of envisioning economic equality for                                 everyone                                --from a leading activist and fashion pioneer.

I am very impressed with this young lady. For that, I want to make sure people read this book.                                      On the other hand, as an audiobook, I found Aurora's reading got harder to take as the more excited she was about what had happened lately, the faster she read. Toward the end of the book, I could barely understand her. Here is the blurb that pulled me to the read. Maybe it reads better in book form or with Kindle text-to-speech.                                      Aurora James’s life is a great American “success story”—precisely because it looks so different from others we’ve seen. Born in Canada to a counterculture mother, James was raised to question everything—specifically the very institutions that have shaped so many of us. When James was seven, her mother married a man who would move them to Jamaica, where James would learn harsh lessons about control, power, abuse, and belonging. Eventually she would find her way back home to Toronto, where her blue-eyed and fair-haired grandmother welcomed her with unconditional love—and inadvertently showed her that racism is the water in which we are all submerged.                                      Scouted as a model in eighth grade, James struggled with body image and became disenchanted by the industry’s objectification of women and commodification of race and culture. After she dropped out of high school, a flirtation with street racing led to her eventual arrest. She’d hit rock bottom, but as a visionary and optimist, she allowed that experience to become one of many that reshaped her way of thinking about the world. A slew of fashion-related jobs led James to discover the real power in creating for the runway, and she started her own business in a flea market: a sustainable fashion line showcasing traditional African designs that would become an award-winning international brand. But none of this came from a drive to “succeed.” It came from a desire to forge a new creative path—and to lift others up alongside her.                                      Already a rising star in fashion and the first Black female designer to win a Council of Fashion Designers of America Award, James posted a revolutionary idea in the wake of George Floyd’s murder that connected economics to racial justice in a way that has forever changed the American economic landscape. With that Instagram post, she founded the Fifteen Percent Pledge, which challenges retailers to commit 15 percent of their shelf space and spending power to Black businesses and is one of the fastest-growing social justice nonprofits. To date, more than two dozen of the world’s most recognized retailers have taken the pledge, redirecting $10 billion in annual revenue to Black and BIPOC brands.                                      Empowering and full of heart, Wildflower is the riveting story of how Aurora James made an indelible mark the American economic system, and a rallying cry for those eager to make change.","304 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","This extraordinary memoir of struggle and perseverance offers new ways of envisioning economic equality for                                 everyone                                --from a leading activist and fashion pioneer.

To be honest, I had not heard of Aurora James. But when I started to read her memoir I had a hard time putting it down. She writes about growing up biracial and witnessing her mother's abuse by her stepfather. As she grows through her teens and early twenties, she loves fashion and does some modeling and other work in the field. However, she hates the marketing aspect of fashion which exacerbates unrealistic and unhealthy body image issues and leads to environmental waste and wage exploitation. She eventually finds her own way towards designing fashion items while mitigating some of the downsides of the business.                                      James' shoes and fashion accessories are handmade in Africa using traditional designs she modified for American markets. The book got slower for me in the middle as she spent a lot of time on the details of her design methods and the process of applying for awards and becoming recognized. Her career at that point is a strange mix of working with local artisans in Africa and trying not to exploit their labor while climbing the ladder of the high fashion world in New York & Los Angeles.                                      The book got more interesting to me again as she hit upon the idea of the 15% Pledge after George Floyd was killed and the BLM movement had a resurgence. The idea is to get major retailers to commit to having Black-owned businesses fill 15% of their shelf space since Black Americans are 15% of the US population. The plan to hold retailers accountable while emphasizing the benefits they would gain from the program was impressively conceived. Overall, a fresh readable memoir, especially for those interested in fashion.","304 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","This extraordinary memoir of struggle and perseverance offers new ways of envisioning economic equality for                                 everyone                                --from a leading activist and fashion pioneer.

I AM SO IMPRESSSED.. with her story, her survivorship and Thrivership, her perspectives. There's so much about her and her writing that the best I can say is GET HER BOOk, GET INSPIRED!! Aurora James is an innovative, persevering, woman that I am nominating for Wonderful Warrior Woman Membership. Her story begins with the love of her grandmother who helped give her the core of being for joy in her life, being loved. She went through molestation and abuse by her mother's husband as an 8 year old. She left high school while doing adult jobs, persevered, kept on working and creating. She struggled financially to establish her community of artisanship. In Africa, she met real artisans who were her inspiration for establishing a company which valued them, paid them for their artistry. I love that. I also love how she put American Consumerism into perspective: Style , fashion stolen by companies to produce mass market knockoff goods produced in China with slave labor. I perhaps should not have been taken aback when I learned that Slave labor Chinese knockoff lace was displacing Nigerian art in Nigeria. Aurora takes on some industrial giants in this book, but NOT just from a 'disclosure' or protest view. She had an epiphany during the George Floyd riots: That ONE voice, specifically asking and stating what was needed, would be heard. She's the innovator and founder of The Fifteen Percent Pledge. Although we see companies advertising with a Person of Color or Even a Family of Color--- if we look at CEO's,Stockholders, actual products made by the Black owned companies --- we see a total absence of Black representation. For example, cosmetic shelves that have products for Black women, but not MADE by a corporation/company that is Black owned... The 15% challenge is for companies to assign 15% of the products they are buying to purchasing them from small Black owned businesses. This challenge is meant for ALL businesses-- all industries. It's also a challenge to the American consumer buying ethically, diversely. Her words at the end of her book summarize the challenge she gives us: ""It will take community. It will take all hands on deck. All stars in alignment. And All birds flying together to that final destination of parity""... Please read her book for an understanding of that allusion of birds flying together, AND for a powerful inspiration. Thanks You Good Reads for one of the most exciting reads of this year in exchange for an honest review.","304 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","This extraordinary memoir of struggle and perseverance offers new ways of envisioning economic equality for                                 everyone                                --from a leading activist and fashion pioneer.

I think this was a great choice to dip my toe into the waters of this new reading medium. I listened to the book while crafting and driving and it perfectly kept my attention.                                      I’ve followed Aurora James on Instagram for several years, aware of her because of her fashion work with Brother Vellies, and was so intrigued listening to the introduction of the memoir and realizing just how little I knew of her background.                                      She has lived so many lives! It’s pretty stunning the amount of ground she covered. She shed light on the good and the bad, from her creative endeavors and building Brother Vellies and The 15 Percent Pledge, to her abuse at the hands of her stepfather and the related fallout with her mother, as well as internal and external tension around her identity as a biracial woman.                                      It was clear she has a real passion for the world around her, and I appreciated her insights/reflections around consumerism, creating opportunities for craftsmen and women around the world, and properly valuing artisans’ work.                                      I value that Aurora chose to narrate the audiobook herself; it made the experience more personal, I was able to glean more nuance from the way she delivered certain lines and it also played into the plot of the book, since her voice is something she’s been criticized over/been picked on for over her life.                                      I really appreciated how transparent and vulnerable she was detailing the struggles she’s experienced with Brother Vellies and how she peeled back the curtain to share what was happening behind the scenes. Oftentimes things were much different from how they appeared on the surface.                                      Aurora has led such a varied and interesting life and I really valued getting to learn more about her and her journey thus far.","304 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","This extraordinary memoir of struggle and perseverance offers new ways of envisioning economic equality for                                 everyone                                --from a leading activist and fashion pioneer.

It is a powerful and compelling one. She is a powerful and compelling woman; a force to be reckoned with, a leading entrepreneur in the fashion design world, and an inspiration to many. Her story is complex and ultimately leads us to the turmoil facing Americans (in particular) today; highlighting and focusing on the disparity between the privileged White community and the Black community who has been not just discriminated against, but oftentimes completely excluded from the financial opportunities necessary to start and grow a business.                                      Her experiences will hold you in thrall and you'll find it hard to put this book down once you begin reading it. By the time you have finished this book, it will very likely have made you feel uncomfortable; and for good reason.                                      She has triumphed over adverse conditions and abuse that have only strengthened her resolve. And she has started a non profit that is signing on top corporations in the U.S. and Canada and putting millions of dollars in Black companies and getting their products in retail outlets finally.                                      This was an eye opening book that will cause readers to reflect on what they are doing or can do to truly help the cause of racial equality and social justice.

I’ve thoroughly enjoyed listening to the audiobook version of Aurora’s story.                                      She takes us on a journey in time, as she recounted her traumatic childhood as a mixed race girl in Canada and Jamaica. She shares her thoughts and ambitions, as transparently as possible and I’m in awe of how much grace she affords her mother.                                      I’ve enjoyed finding out about how she founded Brother Vellies, and how the hardships she faced as a budding designer and entrepreneur led her to creating the 15 Percent Pledge—at such a crucial moment in time.                                      With this book, I fully understand her purpose and how it translates in the different ventures she has devoted herself to. I cannot wait to see what her Friends & Family VC fund does.                                      I wonder how we can channel some of her brilliant ideas —sitting at the intersection of racial and economic justice— to fuel change in other parts of the world.                                      I’ve listened to her audiobook at the beginning of the 2023 uprising that is shaking France following the death of a teenage boy killed by the Police in the Paris suburbs. I can’t help but think that an initiative like the 15 Percent Pledge is direly needed in France to uplift our underprivileged communities and future entrepreneurs.

Aurora James begins her memoir with a comprehensive description of her childhood. This portion of the book laid an interesting foundation of her worldview as a biracial Canadian woman whose family relationships are complex. I knew nothing about Aurora when I began the book and I appreciated connecting to her backstory before learning about her fashion industry connections.                                      I LOVED hearing the ins and outs of Aurora’s experiences building Brother Vellies. She explains in great detail the steps that she took, the roadblocks she experienced, and the inequities she faced as a entrepreneurial woman of color. I learned a lot about the fashion industry and the development of small sustainable brands.                                      The final portion of the book described the launch of the 15% pledge, in which she pressed large corporations to commit to stocking 15% of their merchandise from black owned businesses. This movement came about in the days and weeks following George Floyd’s murder. Aurora called out corporations for performative activism and pushed them to make meaningful change that would impact black business.

I had never heard of Aurora James before reading this book, and I am so glad I know her now! This woman wrote such a vulnerable, captivating, honest, and inspiring book. Her writing voice clearly reflects the type of women she is. She is incredibly inspiring and I hope many young women read this book. Her life story is a testament to the fact that life experiences impact who you are, but do not determine who you. Aurora has built the life she lives and earned the recognition she has received. None of it came easy. The subtle message that while there are some things you can't change, at the end of the day you get to choose who you will be tomorrow was so inspiring. I also loved learning about Aurora's impact on the fashion industry. I gained quite the education on the industry as a whole.

As a fellow Canadian around her age, I had several tinges of nostalgia while reading Wildflower.                                      Her childhood was less than ideal - bouncing between Canada and Jamaica with an evil step-father - is tough to read, but as she mentions later in the memoir, gave her the strength to get through other hardships later in life.

2023-07-03,Everybody Come Alive: A Memoir in Essays,,Marcie Alvis Walker,4.57,"['Memoir', 'Essays', 'Nonfiction', 'Race']",Kindle $12.99,Em,Rating 5 out of 5,"January 24, 2023","In Everybody Come Alive Marcie Alvis Walker writes about being a lover of Black literature but never being able to find a particular type of story. And so she tells us a particular type of Black family story- her story. Growing up with affluent grandparents after her mother dropped her off and left, she never understood if she was being abandoned or if her mother would eventually come back for her. In her mother's eyes, she was better left in the care of her grandparents with the ability to attend predominately white schools with better funding.                                      The opening of the memoir starts with a childhood memory of a white man walking into Marcie's church congregation and disrupting the harmony of worship. A reflection on the way unknown intentions can leave us wondering if we are still safe in our own bodies and in our own communities. There is a thread throughout the essays herein contained that explore the pain of never feeling seen or relishing in the comfort and ease that comes with belonging.                                      The way Marcie writes about her mother is both painful and beautiful, reflective of all the ways daughters admire our mothers for both their strengths and their imperfect humanity. Her mother was God enough to survive a freak train accident but not to escape the voices in her head and there stands Marcie baring witness to it all.                                      The advertisements in between essays are portals back in time displaying the way media portrays blackness adjacent to the way blackness felt in Marcie's experience. Biblical references throughout the storytelling and holy moments told through metaphorical narrative remind us that what trauma teaches us can be sacred, too.

Reading her words is like savoring a decadent dessert.                                      As a white woman, reading her stories and experiences as a Black single mother was heart-breaking. I was devastated to hear about a classical Christian school in Austin held a debate on whether slavery should have been abolished or not. It’s horrifying to hear something like that. As a mom of two who attend a Christian classical school, I can say in NO WAY would that fly at our school. I hope that Marcie spoke up and pressed in on that issue with that community and that they were receptive to her feedback.                                      Additionally, there were a few situations Marcie shared where a white woman said something deeply offensive and racism. I could not tell from her story if she left it un refuted or not. My hope is that Marcie would gently bring such comments to light. As she mentioned how deeply racism runs in our culture without us even recognizing it, it is so incredibly important to talk about it - and address with gentleness and love, as Christ would do, bc so often, aren’t we blind to our own sins?                                      Marcie’s depiction of the Triune God, 3 in 1, with both male and female qualities was absolutely beautiful. I have always viewed the Holy Spirit as a Mother so this resonated with me.                                      Finally, the hurt that Marcie has experienced from her upbringing, especially her mother, was raw and real and shared in an incredibly honest but also blame-free way. She did such a great job of honoring her family members while also sharing the hard truth and her processing of those feelings.                                      Oh - and I found the home life at her mother’s house with the other Black women fascinating! The hot hair combs and food and talk was so intriguing!                                      And Marcie’s way of weaving news headlines, blurbs, poetry, different voices and narrative was brilliant.                                      Thank you, Marcie, for writing such a vulnerable memoir with such spiritual depth and resonance. I read it in two days. 😂","288 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","A dazzling memoir that explores what it means to become fully alive and holy when we embrace the silenced stories we've inherited--from the creator of Black Coffee with White Friends                                 .

Walker’s ability to quickly cut to the core of a deep and difficult truth, while writing about it the most poetic and gorgeous prose, continually blows me away, and this memoir captures that same feeling.                                      Everybody Come Alive is Walker’s story in particular, but it is also the story of discovering what it means to be Black, a woman, and a person who is holy, beloved, and fully alive in America today. This book is raw, honest, and vulnerable yet also joyful and hopeful. What a gift she has given the world by sharing her story so powerfully and generously.

I love being Black. I love my skin, my culture, its language, and its vibe.”                                      “How are we as Christians supposed to undo this? Where do we begin? Perhaps we begin by decolonizing our understanding of who is holy and who is beautiful.”                                      I had the honor of reading an advance copy of this beautiful new book scheduled to release on May 30. Though I have followed Marcie for a while on Instagram and expected it to be a great one, I was blown away by how gorgeous the writing is. It is textured, unique, and absolutely spellbinding! Marcie is an incredibly gifted storyteller who writes “…a story about the complexity of one human experience, my experience of being Black, woman, and holy.”                                      The book is divided into 3 parts: Black, Woman, and Holy. She shares stories from her childhood as the daughter of a mother who was in love with her Blackness but struggled with mental illness. She moved back and forth between her mother’s world and that of her grandparents, who helped raise her in a world that was much more immersed in whiteness. She also shares about her experience as a Black single mother.                                      It's difficult to know how to write about this book, other than to say that you have to experience it. Through captivating stories, Marcie weaves throughout the book threads of what it has meant to her to be Black, woman, and holy. I loved this book so much and felt honored to bear witness to her journey of becoming. What a gift.","288 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 30, 2023","A dazzling memoir that explores what it means to become fully alive and holy when we embrace the silenced stories we've inherited--from the creator of Black Coffee with White Friends                                 .

Middle School                                      is a fantastic and moving graphic novel of a slightly fictionalized version on their 7th grade experience growing up in Canada, a book I knew I                                       had                                      to have as soon as I saw the great artistic prodigy,                                       Tillie Walden                                      was providing the artwork (                                       On A Sunbeam                                      remains an all-time favorite graphic novel for me). We watch the twins face learning a new school and new friendships (while trying to keep their best-friend in the loop), adapting to the changes of puberty, and entering the tumultuous emotions of first crushes, but a chance discovery of their mom’s boyfriend’s old guitar might change their lives forever and give them an outlet for their feelings. Fans of the duo will enjoy this look into their early years though strangers to the music will find this to be just as heartfelt and endearing. Gorgeously illustrated and handling topics with humor and sensitivity,                                       Middle School                                      is an absolute delight that effectively captures the pre-teen vibes and might even inspire you to grab a guitar. So                                       why don’t you come a little closer                                      and let's talk about this lovely book.                                       First performance                                      Just based on the band and artist I knew I was going to love this, but the message on finding your friends and who you are hit especially well for me. When the album                                       Heartthrob                                      dropped in 2013, I had just started a part time job at a Barnes and Noble in a city I didn’t know and far from any friends I’d ever had after basically fleeing working a factory job I hated (okay so I                                       might                                      have tried to start a union at my Uncle’s factory. I’d say we don’t talk about this but nobody from that part of the fam even talks to me since then so it’s cool). Heartthrob and the first Lorde album happened to be the only two in-store-play albums we had at the time so it got a lot of play, which was great because I fell in love with it and I remember making a joke with a coworker about how whenever                                       Closer                                      came on we’d instinctively start shelving faster like it was some 80s workout video. So you know you are doing well enough as the new person if the cool employee with a Libertines tattoo doesn’t hate you, and a lot of old memories associated with really enjoying all the Tegan and Sara albums came back reading this (like my oldest seeing them as a first concert). So reading a book with that connection about finding friends and fitting in way nice as most of my friends 10 years later I people I met working at Barnes and now 3 of us share an office together working the library (and yes we have a union here) so that’s a happy ending.                                      But back to this book because it really is quite lovely and—as expected—Tillie Walden’s artwork is phenomenal. I mean:                                       Tillie Walden superfan right here                                      Sara and Tegan are identical twins, so to help the reader keep them apart Tegan is often represented with the color blue while Sara through the color red. There are quite a lot of characters here which can be tough to keep straight sometimes but Walden switches up their hair enough to keep them in order. The story is rather episodic while having overarching elements such as Sara crushing on one friend while Tegan is navigating trying to be best friend’s with Noa despite Noa’s other best friend being a total bully and downer (this is                                       packed                                      with middle school drama!), but it all flows quite well and has a good comfortable pace that makes it feel like you are reading a full year of growth without ever feeling like it drags. I also enjoyed that, despite being their graphic memoir, the story is pushed to take place in the present as it will resonate more with middle or high school readers. Texting is very central to the communication in the book yet it does still retain a sort of “timeless” pre-teen feel that anyone will empathize with.                                       Teenage Tegan and Sara performing                                      I really enjoyed getting bits about the twins forming a band as well, here named Gunk (instead of Plunk, which was their actual first band name). We see how songwriting becomes a way to express complex emotions in a productive way and how quickly the twins take to putting effort in the music (also the difficulty of balancing art with school work). For those looking for more, Tegan and Sara released a memoir in 2019,                                       High School                                      , that tells the “true” story, and their 2019 album                                       Hey, I’m Just Like You                                      is a reworking of many of the songs they wrote as teenagers and are alluded to in this book.                                      Even if you’ve never heard of this group (would recommend checking them out) you can get just as much out of the book as anyone else. It is quite a moving and familiar story and I just loved it. Walden does such an excellent job with the artwork, the story is really endearing, and everything about it just works. Also this would be a perfect way to kickstart Pride Month starting this week!                                       4.5/5","304 pages, Paperback                             First published May 30, 2023","Based on the young lives of Grammy-nominated indie-pop twin-sister duo Tegan and Sara, who have sold well over a million records, with artwork from Eisner Award-winner Tillie Walden, this opening book of a middle-grade graphic novel duology explores growing up, coming out, and finding yourself through music and sisterhood.

Before the indie-pop duo Tegan and Sara took the world by storm, Tegan and Sara Quin were identical twins trying to find their place in a new home and new school.                               Tegan and Sara: Junior High                              tells their story. From first crushes to the perils of puberty, surviving junior high is something the sisters plan to face side by side, just like they've always faced things. But growing up also means growing apart, as Tegan and Sara make different friends and take separate paths to understanding their queerness. For the first time ever, they ask who one sister is without the other.                              Set in the present day, this inspiring, lightly fictionalized autobiography offers a glimpse at Tegan and Sara before they became icons, exploring their shifting sisterhood, their own experiences coming out, and the first steps of their musical journey."

I had to keep reminding myself though that I am not the intended audience and I think it'll be great for middle grade readers.                                        As a mum of twins, it was lovely reading about realistic twin relationships. It's not all picture perfect where they're BFFs. Sometimes, there is a bit of animosity between twins and I can only imagine how it'll be during the middle grade years when they are also trying to work out their own individuality. I really enjoyed this part of the graphic novel.

Though I'll admit, I did read it specifically for Tegan & Sara + I love Tillie Walden (win-win-win), soooo the changes that they made to make it relevant to junior high kids today were kinda a bummer. I wanted to know what bands they were really into and who their music idols were in real life, because unless Billie Eilish is a time traveler, I'm pretty sure she wasn't alive when they were 12.                                               ... but I do understand the need to make it relevant to the 12 & 13 year olds of 2023 since it's being marketed for them and not necessarily for mid (late) 20 somethings who grew up loving Tegan and Sara.

Tillie Walden's artwork is amazing as always here, and I've come to never expect less. The writing, however, didn't work nearly as well for me. The writing style felt clumsy, but I was especially alienated by the choices when it comes to fictionalizing the story.                                            The story is based on Tegan and Sara's actual lives, but it's fictionalized by setting this story in the present day. I think this was a strange choice because their experiences were clearly influenced by growing up in the 90s, so it was alienating to read some of the ways the story was updated to the present day.

If you’re looking for a new coming of age story, JUNIOR HIGH is it. In a fictionalized retelling of Tegan and Sara’s life in junior high, we follow the twins through all of their struggles: parent’s divorce, first crushes, sexuality awakenings, bullying, and trying to make friends.                                        I enjoyed how the story was told despite it being fictionalized to fit modern times with references to the Nintendo Switch, Billie Ellish, and Stranger Things. JUNIOR HIGH is a relatable read for anyone who survived middle school and for queer kids especially.                                        I’ve learned recently that I like reading books following twins. It’s such a unique perspective especially in graphic novel form. In JUNIOR HIGH, Sara’s color is red, and Tegan is blue which helps the reader tell them apart.                                        I knew of Tegan and Sara before reading this graphic novel, but I didn’t know much about their life. I appreciated the author’s note at the end of the book because it shares what the real-life situation was from the fictionalized version.

With a mix of autobiography and fiction, the characters felt genuine and robust. There were laugh out loud moments, and moments where I was getting teary eyed. The feelings and experiences felt authentic to the age being represented. I think everyone will be able to relate to some aspect of this story even if they are unfamiliar with the authors and their music. The artwork was soft, warm; the use of color to represent the different perspectives was great. I enjoyed the level of detail, and the artist did a good job of making it so the large cast of characters were easy to distinguish from each other. It was nice to see that the book did not shy away from topics like getting your period and trying to figure out the romantic feelings happening inside and similar things that middle grade kids face in real life.

I've been a lifelong Tegan and Sara fan. literally. my first two cds, cds that were MINE, were ""so jealous"" and p!nk's ""m!ssundaztood"" when I was 6 years old. legendary. and I wish I had had this book then.                                      first off, I think this is illustrated so well by Tillie Walden, and I loved how she used color to differentiate between Tegan (blue) and Sara (red), the rest of the novel being illustrated in purple. so smart, so obvious, but effective! loved that.                                      I also loved how accessible this was. it tackled periods, queer awakenings, sibling dynamics, big moves as a kid, the confusion of friendships, and while it definitely could have gone deeper, I think it was great (especially with the visuals!!) for the age range it's intended for. there were a lot of moments that put me in touch with my younger self in very tender ways.                                      I will say that I think the dialogue was a bit weak at times, but again, I think that can help with accessibility and ease of reading! it's also literally written for kids! so I wasn't expecting a literary masterpiece.                                      I do wish it had been set in the 90s and been more true to Tegan and Sara's actual experiences. I didn't love the use of current media information/texting, but I do get that it probably made the storytelling easier and more effective for the audience. but I think a 90s setting could've worked just as well, honestly.                                      overall, super cute, real, and accessible.

Reading this brought back my own memories of middle school - the awkwardness, the fun times, the friendships, the fights, and all the first experiences that seem so earthshaking in the moment. The story is really relatable and is perfect for middle grade readers. Tillie Walden's art is lovely as always, with a special softness that communicates feelings so well. Tegan and Sara's story is full of early self discovery, questioning, and trying new things. The girls are confronted with new challenges - being in separate classes, making different friends, facing a class bully, family changes, and miscommunication. But no matter what, their bond remains true, and they're always loved and supported by their parents. I especially liked that the parents manage to be cool and passionate about their interests while also maintaining boundaries and rules. And, of course, they still do embarrassing parent things!

After flourishing in the musical landscape for more than 20 years, the Twins are set to conquer publishing. After the success of ""High School,"" they turned their introspective, frank storytelling style into a graphic novel for the young'uns: ""Tegan and Sara: Junior High."" Their experiences are relatable to many a North American teen: kissin' and cryin' and singin' and laughin' and -- in so many cases -- menstruatin' through life.                                      The perfectly-titled pseudo-memoir follows our titular heroines through a contemporary version of their junior high (middle school, to Americans) experience. Part of us yearns for the early-90s experience to be told and drawn in all its grungy glory, but the bump to a 2022 universe may help the work resonate with YA readers more strongly. Storywise, the graphic novel is all ""Hey, I'm Just Like You."" Tonally, though, it's a perfect companion piece to the poppier, more neon ""Heartthrob."" The song and video for ""Closer"" make an excellent side dish to ""Junior High.""                                      Autobiography and memoir is a solitary activity. What makes the tale -- and the dual-colored illustrations -- so unique is the omnipresence of Another Perspective. The girls, perched precariously on the edge of puberty, tell their story both together and apart -- interrupting core memories with metafictional observations and emotional outbursts that explode across pages. The novel's surrealist manipulation of time, space, and biology is made all the more striking by Tillie Walden's detailed, yet unfussy, illustrations. She eschews conventional, boxy panels in favor of a more abstract, free-flowing journey through the girls' minds.                                      The memoir, which culminates with a life-changing creative discovery, is a marvelous glimpse into those tiny moments of queer self-discovery that we remember equal parts nostalgia and terror. But, as they should, our trio of artists focus on the many things that unify and separate the sisters -- queer discovery included -- rather than becoming exclusively a Lesbian Coming-of-Age story.                                      ""Junior High"" is must-read for middle school and high school kids, especially those who menstruate, as the book handles the topic with both frankness and humor. And it's the kind of queer fiction we want: stories about queer people's lives that aren't only about their queerness. We're more than Just Gay -- we also get chicken pox, learn to play guitar, and embarrass ourselves beyond redemption at every turn. -- Dustin K.

Highlights include the sibling/sister/twin relationship, the connection both characters reveal to music, and the way that their queerness comes through in their music, their thoughts, and their interactions. There's a great authors' note providing more insight into these points for the real Tegan and Sara, and that is not to be missed.                                      This is a quick, clear read, and fans of these two will enjoy getting 'a little bit closer' to the characters and authors in the process.                                      *Special thanks to NetGalley and Farrar, Straus & Giroux for this arc, which I received in exchange for an honest review.

The author, an Englishwoman and an editor at Harper's Magazine who lives in New York, goes against the grain of her Oxford education, where she was taught to analyze the books she was reading dispassionately, without regard for the author's lives or her own lived experience. Here, she takes us on a tour de force through the writings and lives of Mary Wollstonecraft, George Eliot, Zora Neale Hurston, Virginia Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir, Sylvia Plath, Toni Morrison, and Elena Ferrante. Biggs combines memoir, detailing the aftermath of her divorce and her move from London to Brooklyn, NY, with literary criticism and close reading. Her reading is very different than the standard academic readings you would do in an English class. She weaves snippets from the lives of these trailblazing women with the lessons she learned and how she used their writings and their lives to inform her own life path and thinking. The result is a literary feast. Those who haven't read these seminal works, such as Beloved, To the Lighthouse, and Ariel, will hunger to get their hands on copies. Those who've read them will want to reread them. Highly recommend, with the caveat that there may be some spoilers if you're someone who reads for the plot.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated Book of 2023 by the New York Times , The Week , Vulture , Elle, and The Millions A piercing blend of memoir, criticism, and biography examining how women writers across the centuries carved out intellectual freedom for themselves—and how others might do the same I took off my wedding ring for the last time—a gold band with half a line of “Morning Song” by Sylvia Plath etched inside—and for weeks afterwards, my thumb would involuntarily reach across my palm for the warm bright circle that had gone.

I'm usually not a fan of author's putting their own story in the mix when discussing these legendary authors (Sylvia Plath, Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, etc) but Joanna Biggs walks this line beautifully. Her story helps put the others in perspective, it brings them back to Earth where they belong.                                      This book is a reminder that women's literature is more than just the words on the page. It is connection, it is community, it is conflict, and it is love.

She turns to other women writers who have gone through similar mid-life changes to discover how their lives and their writing changed. She examines Mary Wollstonecraft, George Elliot, Zora Neale Hurston, Virginia Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir, Silvia Plath, Toni Morrison and Elena Ferrante. The similar thread is the balance of love and freedom and how the lives behind these women writers impacts their work and the writers who come after them. As a woman in my forties, it was also encouraging to read about the women who were late starters and who needed some life behind them before they were ready to establish their work. I think that I may have tried to read this too quickly and I would recommend spacing out the reading of each chapter so they don’t run together.

More often than not, I only read the synopsis once, which is when I am at the point of deciding whether or not to buy it. This put me at a slight disadvantage, because I’d have loved to read this book after reading all its source material. That being said, finishing this immediately bumped up the works of Eliot, Beauvoir, and Ferrante on my TBR. I cannot wait to reread this after I go through them!                                      A Life of One’s Own reminded me a lot of the reading experience of The Lonely City by Olivia Laing, albeit a lot less visual. The book explores Biggs’ life following her divorce, as she sought to find meaning through the lives of eight women authors: Wollstonecraft, Eliot, Hurston, Woolf, Beauvoir, Plath, Morrison, and Ferrante. The title suggests a ninth, and that refers to our author, Biggs.                                      Majority of the chapters focus on these writers’ lives, where Biggs painstakingly takes out fragments of each and attempts to place them in alignment with hers. The act in itself is almost poetic, similar to how we often turn to movies, books, and songs in times of despair; trying to find some sense and meaning in situations we believe are so similar to ours.                                      I feel like my worldview has shifted with this book. While some of the biographical material is arguably well-known across the readership, it’s the very act of piecing them together and cross-referencing each authors’ lives that makes it so incredibly special. Biggs’ writing is open, conversational, and warm, inviting the reader to explore these lives with her. There’s not a tone of pretense; of admitting some form of higher knowledge in this book. Biggs’ work is profound without explicit demand of such.                                      My favorite chapters are the ones on Woolf, Beavouir, Plath, and Ferrante. I’ve always felt some sort of kinship in Plath—my life has not necessarily been as harrowing as hers, but I often sympathized with her inability to deem herself satisfied with her current state. I found comfort in Biggs’ segment on her—making me feel slightly more sane to know I wasn’t alone in looking up to Plath in such a degree.                                      This is the kind of book I would’ve picked up, regardless of whether or not it was gifted. That being said, I am so incredibly grateful to @eccobooks for gifting me this gem. This comes out on May 16, 2023, and I cannot WAIT to get my hands on a physical copy so I can annotate it in the degree it so willingly deserves. 5 stars.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated Book of 2023 by the New York Times , The Week , Vulture , Elle, and The Millions A piercing blend of memoir, criticism, and biography examining how women writers across the centuries carved out intellectual freedom for themselves—and how others might do the same I took off my wedding ring for the last time—a gold band with half a line of “Morning Song” by Sylvia Plath etched inside—and for weeks afterwards, my thumb would involuntarily reach across my palm for the warm bright circle that had gone.

In the aftermath of her divorce, Biggs embarks on a personal reckoning with the ideal of female domesticity and her deep need to create a life that allows her to center her own creative work. In the time following her break up and her mother’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis, Biggs turned to the female authors she idolized in her youth. Doing so, she hoped that their lives and their work would give her a semblance of a way forward through her own wreckage.                                      Biggs finds herself taking solace in the lives and the turmoils of these nine women who came before her. Breaking with the tradition of her Oxford education, where she was taught to analyze the books she was reading dispassionately, without regard for the author's lives or her own lived experience. In doing so, Biggs and the reader are reminded that literature written by women is so often much more than just the words written on the page. It is a web of connection, community, understanding, and creation of place.                                      I definitely enjoyed the informative aspect of this book. Getting to experience a deeper dive into the lives behind some larger names in literature, and how they made their own way in societies where the odds were stacked against them. Biggs weaves the life stories and discussions of each author within her own timeline wonderfully. The result is a fascinating meditation on literature, friendship, desire, the life of the mind, and the woman writers’ persistent struggle of making space to be free.

It gave me a deep understanding of the lives of women through the works of iconic authors. I feel like I learned so much and want to revisit so many of the books I haven't read before. The author did an amazing job of weaving her own story throughout the text, which made it even more enjoyable to read. I thought it was such a powerful message, showing that divorce or leaving a man does not mean the end for a woman. She still can have a successful career and her success is not only linked to a marriage or children. You are not a failure or too old to decide to leave a marriage.                                      The audiobook was a good option but I would probably have enjoyed it more if I had the physical copy so I could annotate it and make it easier to make a list of the amazing works referenced here that I feel like adding to my TBR. If a book induces you to look for more books and feel passionate about an author's life - I count it as a success. I'll admit that I just found this story to drag, it felt very interesting but then it went on for so long and I had to force myself to get back to it. I feel the miss is due to the format more than the theme.

Unfortunately, it did not live up to that expectation for me. The authors chosen were well-known, and all spoke to a personal connection with Biggs, but their stories are well-known as well, and so I didn't feel I learned much of anything new from the events in their lives this book chose to focus on. The moments themselves weren't always well-defined, the ""beginning again"" sometimes a mere suggestion, rather than a turning point. The author's own story - of processing through and finding freedom after a divorce, at times seemed an interruption from the real ""meat"" of the stories she was telling, and their lessons to her not always clear. This book did do a great job, though, of presenting the idea of legacy and tradition among women writers - women influencing women through their works, all the way through the author herself. Not in showcasing moments of re-beginnings, but in connecting these writers, did this book succeed.","272 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 16, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated Book of 2023 by the New York Times , The Week , Vulture , Elle, and The Millions A piercing blend of memoir, criticism, and biography examining how women writers across the centuries carved out intellectual freedom for themselves—and how others might do the same I took off my wedding ring for the last time—a gold band with half a line of “Morning Song” by Sylvia Plath etched inside—and for weeks afterwards, my thumb would involuntarily reach across my palm for the warm bright circle that had gone.

In each essay of this hilarious, heartfelt, and pitch-perfectly honest memoir, journalist Connie Wang explores her complicated relationship to her stubborn and charismatic mother, Qing Li, through the ""oh my god"" moments in their travels together. From attending a Magic Mike strip show in Vegas to experimenting with edibles in Amsterdam to flip-flopping through Versailles, this iconic mother-daughter duo venture into the world to find their place in it, and sometimes rail against it--as well as against each other.                              There are hijinks, capers, and adventures. There is also tenderness, growth, and discovery. In telling these stories about the places they've gone and the things they've done, Wang reveals another story: the true story of two women who finally learned that once we are comfortable with the feeling of not belonging--once we can reject the need to belong to any place, community, census, designation, or nation--we can experience something almost like freedom."

Blending personal essays and memoirs, Wang explores her relationship with her mom, Qing Li, through nine adventures from visiting family in China, trying out edibles in Amsterdam, and going on a fashion expedition in Paris.                                      At the center of the book is Qing, Wang's charismatic & humorous mother. Qing immigrated from China and found herself lost in a different culture and lost to child-rearing responsibilities. While Wang discusses loss and heartache, I particularly adore her writing about her adventures with Qing. Qing's candor is something that shines through OH MY MOTHER and made me miss my mom's bluntness 🥲                                      I also appreciate Wang's inclusion of different topics, from her complicated feelings toward Disney World to her time as an editor attending fashion shows. These subjects veer away from the slanty-eye jokes, your-lunch-smells-funny comments, and you-must-have-plagiarized-to-write-something-this-good remarks. And I loved reading OH MY MOTHER, which doesn't solely focus on trauma and lets the joy of being an immigrant/first-generation Asian American shine through.                                      At its core, OH MY MOTHER is a celebration of mother-daughter relationships through phases of growth and discovery, allowing us to find a community, a home, and freedom.

I laughed a lot at the visuals peppered throughout the stories, but what I really appreciated were the sparks of clarity derived from Connie’s missteps, and the way interactions were examined without assigning anyone a strict villain role within a scenario (wires get crossed and it’s ok!).                                      I think pages 26-28 set the theme for me for the book-how the lack of a common mother tongue impacts communication, and how this in turn becomes the catalyst for misunderstandings and curled shrimp moments. What I took away from this was a reminder that people are trying their best with what they were equipped with, and that as an adult I should be capable of seeing my parents as just that.

I was really excited for this book after reading Wang's article in NYT - however, I felt like this book fell short. I read a lot of Asian American literature, especially memoirs, and I don't know if I'm growing tired of the genre or it's just not as fresh as it used to be. The premise of this book is that Wang understands her mother more through various ""adventures"" they share, but the book seems entirely superficial. It is told entirely from Wang's perspective and I feel like we barely get an idea of what her mom is feeling without it being heavily filtered through her own perspective. Each chapter ends in a way that appears premature - Wang reaches some newfound conclusion that doesn't feel earned or explained. Much of Wang's story should have resonated deeply with me since I've felt a lot of the niche feelings she's felt before and we share many specific family experiences - however, the writing has some element of self-loathing or self-righteousness that I couldn't get past. I thought it would evolve as the book moved through her life but it never did.                                      This review feels a little harsh for a book I found enjoyable and a quick read, but I also found it kind of forgettable.

She also connected their stories to bigger events and things happening in the world, in a seamless and almost essay-style writing that appeared throughout.                                      She writes about her experience being a first-generation Chinese American (and her mom’s experience as an immigrant), her feelings toward Disney World, her time as an editor at Refinery29, packing for travel, her house growing up, and so much more. And she does so with such fantastic storytelling.

Me encanta :D                                      En estas nueve historias, Connie nos cuenta acerca de su vida y el impacto que su madre ha tenido en ella. Llegaremos a conocer su relación a veces conflictiva y otras enternecedora. Algo importante en estas historias, no es la presencia activa de Qing, sino las enseñanzas que transmitió a Connie para que tomara las decisiones que se adecuaran no a las expectativas culturales, sino a las propias. Se exploran desde su perspectiva personal y familiar las cosas positivas y negativas de migrar: su lucha silenciosa contra la xenofobia y el conflicto interno por el choque cultural.                                      El hilo conductor de estas nueve aventuras son los momentos intensos en los que ha reconocido a su madre en ella misma o la comprensión de un aspecto de Qing que le había pasado desapercibido. Me gustó el proceso de descubrir quién es Qing Li no sólo como madre, sino como compañera de viaje, como amiga y como un ser libre, que sólo se pertenece a sí misma.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","""Hilarious, candid, and heartfelt . . .

Self-deprecating at times, hilarious at others and heartfelt throughout, Connie's writing (honed by Qing's editing) riveted me to their stories and their journey together to the present day. While Connie wrote that she and Qing were lucky ""to not belong, together"" (emphasizing the importance of proper punctuation :P), I would propose that in the recounting of their lives they belong to themselves, and to the world. And we are better for it. This book certainly belongs on all readers' ""to be read"" or ""read"" lists, and I so very much look forward to reading whatever Connie writes next.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","""Hilarious, candid, and heartfelt . . .

This book of essays tells stories that are eerily similar to the experiences I had growing up with immigrant Chinese parents. Every immigrant story is different, yet the many parallels make me feel seen and heard and not so alone.                                      Her stories are earnest and genuine, painting a true picture of her childhood and the many formative interactions she had with her mother. Wang's writing is entertaining, humorous, and unabashedly transparent. As the book progresses, the stories get more literary and, in my opinion, less compelling. However, the focus is always on the evolving relationship between mother and daughter and the difficult situations they face together.

I felt like I was reading someone's journal, temporarily immersed in the author's personal writing and honest thoughts but quickly moving on. From the synopsis I thought it would be a travelogue, but it is more of a memoir reflecting on her relationship with her mother with traveling as a loose structure; vacations are a memorable source of stories away from daily life.

2023-07-03,Boyslut: A Memoir and Manifesto,,Zachary Zane,4.05,"['Nonfiction', 'Queer', 'LGBT', 'Memoir', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Bisexual']",Kindle $9.99,ancientreader,Rating 3 out of 5,"November 15, 2022","A potentially valuable book that significantly undermines its own value.                                      Of course sexual shame is as pervasive and as damaging as Zane argues, and much of the information and advice here seems likely to benefit people who take it to heart. Most people probably know at least one man who suffers from “normative male alexithymia,” for example – the problem of not recognizing and being able to express one’s own feelings – and simply having that problem identified might start the process of undoing it. And practically everyone in the world would, in my opinion as well as Zane’s, be a lot happier if we could talk about sex as openly as we talk about, say, tastes in food, or how to cook a particular dish. I agree, too, that sexual shaming is destructive. Plenty of people need to hear that there’s nothing wrong with their fantasies or with their (consensual) sex of any variety.                                      Three aspects of this book undermine its messages and its value. One is technical: incompetent editing. Whoever prepared this manuscript doesn’t know how “blond” and “blonde” work, or how many exclamation points is too damn many, or how to use hyphens, for starters; also, overall the prose needs tightening up.                                      The other two aspects are substantive. (1) I agree with Zane’s general point that in principle there’s nothing wrong with depictions of explicit sex, either written or visual. But labor conditions for sex workers are generally suboptimal, and to leave that unacknowledged and unaddressed strikes me as careless, as in uncaring. It wouldn’t have gone amiss to offer tips for how to identify porn producers who treat their actors well, for example.                                      (2) Zane takes a cavalier attitude toward antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea. This is inexcusable. Gonorrhea has already become resistant to one class of                                       antibiotics                                      , and every avoidable infection now being treated with cephalosporins represents another tiny increment toward resistance to those as well. I’m sorry Zane has a hard time coming with a condom on, but them’s the breaks if he wants to behave responsibly, not only toward his partners but also toward readers of his advice column and of this book.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated LGBTQ+ Book of the Year by Buzzfeed                              A sex and relationship columnist bares it all in a series of essays—part memoir, part manifesto—that explore the author’s coming-of-age and coming out as a bisexual man and move toward embracing and celebrating sex unencumbered by shame                              As a boy, Zachary Zane sensed that all was not right when images of his therapist naked popped into his head. Without an explanation as to why, a deep sense of shame pervaded these thoughts. Though his therapist assured him a little imagination was nothing to be ashamed of, over the years, society told him otherwise.                              Boyslut is a series of personal and tantalizing essays that articulate how our society still shames people for the sex that they have and the sexualities that they inhabit.

That said, this book was A Lot. I wanted to read it because of the bi male rep, and had not heard of or read Zachary Zane's sex column prior to requesting the title. Maybe if I had I would have gone in a little better prepared for what I was about to read. Like, I was expecting sex positivity, and instead got Full! Unbridled! Hedonism! In a way that almost made it seem if you are having what I would call textbook American sex life (monogamous, third date, occasional rando hookup, whatever) you're not really leaning in. It implied that all people want so much sex all the time and our repressed culture is PREVENTING THAT!!                                      As an a-spec person, I wanted to go around to everyone I know and ask really? Is that really how most people feel? (Especially bi and gay men?) Or is this sex columnist misrepresenting the mainstream population in favor of his manifesto?                                      I seriously delayed writing this review because I didn't want to seem judgy, and I know that I'm going to come across that way. There was a lot about this that was very enlightening. (Like, I knew about Grindr as a gay hook up app, but I didn't really realize the practical application of sex at your door in 9 minutes, over in 9 minutes).                                      I think the one thing that I vehemently disagreed with, from a public health standpoint, is his laissez-faire attitude toward STIs. (They're treatable! Just get treated for them and don't worry about protecting yourself!) But I really did like the way he communicated that people shouldn't feel shame for their desires, even the most out there ones, because as a whole I think that's a positive message.                                      As a whole, a fascinating book and a fast read, but also one that left me feeling like there is better sex positive messaging out there. As a memoir though, fairly entertaining, if completely beyond my depth.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated LGBTQ+ Book of the Year by Buzzfeed                              A sex and relationship columnist bares it all in a series of essays—part memoir, part manifesto—that explore the author’s coming-of-age and coming out as a bisexual man and move toward embracing and celebrating sex unencumbered by shame                              As a boy, Zachary Zane sensed that all was not right when images of his therapist naked popped into his head.

First, I'm too old. Every sex positive person over thirty already knows what Zachary Zane is preaching, chapter and verse.

At this point, only the most sheltered kids don't know about sex and sexuality. Even enraged Christian evangelicals watch porn, and lots of it. Now that everyone has access to all the information they could ever want regarding sex, who else is there left to enlighten on this subject?

If I had to sum up this book in just one word, it would be acceptance. Zane writes about the need to accept who we are and who or what we want to be. Through therapy, socialization, and life experience he explores a journey to self-acceptance that assures us it's okay (and healthy) to have questions and doubts, but also insists we don't let them get in the way of living our lives. It's not an easy journey, and not one without its detours and switchbacks, but he invites us to share in the experiences that allowed him to grow mentally, physically, and emotionally into the titular Boyslut. At the same time, he confronts the attitudes, assumptions, and anxieties that stand in the way of society accepting such an open and joyous indulgence of sexuality.                                      One thing that struck me about the book is how Zane explores definitions of bisexuality versus pansexuality, and how he deliberately claims the former not in spite of but because of its social stigma, even as he goes to great pains to regularly assure the reader that transgender, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming individuals are included in his definition. And it's not in a by-the-way aside or pandering way, it's sincere inclusion that I appreciated every time.                                      For a book about sex, what I think resonates most is what Zane has to say about relationships, the intersection of love and sex, and how and where the two can divulge. There are some interesting explorations of polyamory and open marriage that I found encouraging, and some frank discussion of how intimacy can interfere with sexual attraction - not because we've ""fallen out of love"" but because our sexual attraction may work differently. Yes, there's a lot of talk about random hookups and one-night stands, but there are also feelings and emotions to navigate.                                      Admittedly, I was a little taken aback by the frankness with which Zane discusses drug use, and the way he so casually dismisses STIs, but I realized you can't pick-and-choose your stigmas. He's writing about an openness and honesty that you can't fairly compartmentalize or place conditions on, and the admissions about his own behavior are all part of being a Boyslut. In some ways, I wish I had his confidence, his sort of selfishness, but there are consequences within even an open marriage that I feel demand more consideration.                                       https://sallybend.wordpress.com/2023/...","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated LGBTQ+ Book of the Year by Buzzfeed                              A sex and relationship columnist bares it all in a series of essays—part memoir, part manifesto—that explore the author’s coming-of-age and coming out as a bisexual man and move toward embracing and celebrating sex unencumbered by shame                              As a boy, Zachary Zane sensed that all was not right when images of his therapist naked popped into his head.

I appreciated the open and honest manner in which Zane discusses the role of kink in queer sex and how easy it is for bedroom-related shame to seep into the everyday lives of LGBTQ+ folks: withdrawal, lashing out, difficulty trusting and fostering connection. Talking about sex and destigmatizing non-heteronormative and kinky sex in particular is beneficial for everyone in the end, especially in the face of a rising movement to deemphasize sex when discussing sexuality. I thought the sections on normative male alexithymia -- the societal conditioning of men to suppress feelings and the problems this leads to with recognizing and labeling emotions, let alone expressing them -- were particularly interesting.                                      There’s also lots of intriguing observations around love and sex, where they intersect, where they diverge, and the complicated navigation and exploration of sexual attraction, romance, and intimacy in the LGBTQ+ community. There’s musings on masculinity, monogamy, and marriage. Theses on porn, Pride, and polyamory. Essays on self-loathing, self-doubt, and self-care. Ruminations on religion, Grindr, and the backroom at the Eagle. And lots of talk about the importance and the struggle of finding good queer-friendly therapists, especially since gay and bi men are 4x more likely to die by suicide than their straight counterparts.                                      All in all, a worthy read for anyone interested in the ways sex affects our lives, our society, and our relationship with each other (all the ways), but especially if you like you some dude-on-dude action.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated LGBTQ+ Book of the Year by Buzzfeed                              A sex and relationship columnist bares it all in a series of essays—part memoir, part manifesto—that explore the author’s coming-of-age and coming out as a bisexual man and move toward embracing and celebrating sex unencumbered by shame                              As a boy, Zachary Zane sensed that all was not right when images of his therapist naked popped into his head.

I believe that if we can understand these systems, we can all unfuck ourselves. —                                      When I first heard about Boyslut by Zachary Zane, the fact it was a memoir instantly was what interested me as I’ve been severely lacking with my nonfiction. The word slut just added more enthusiasm for my need to read this book. What I was expecting with Boyslut was a 200+ page book on what I was guessing was going to be wild sex escapades and unapologetic horniness (which is totally my thing,) but instead I got a very touching, educational & thought provoking memoir that will be going highly on my recommended list for the soul reason that it nearly made me piss my pants with laughter.                                      Now, I’m very comfortable with sex, everyone who knows me knows it’s my favourite topic of discussion and that I can talk for hours about puking, pissing and whatever else picks my fancy for the day, which is why Boyslut felt like I was chatting with an old friend. I felt familiar, I felt like there were parts where I wanted to just shake the book because                                       yes, finally someone else who understands.                                      It’s the first book that really made me feel unashamed for how much I love sex, especially right now with this huge wave of censorship, it further reinforced why I so passionately talk about sex and all the things that comes with sex. There was also a quote I wrote down while reading that also furthers the point that you shouldn’t feel guilt for engaging in sex, kinks & fantasies;                                       — But when I'm masturbating in the shower, and a violent sexual scene mysteriously appears in my mind, I don't spend the next five hours worried about whether I'm secretly a depraved and perverted sicko. I simply shoot my load and carry on with my merry day. Besides, I'm most definitely a little pervert, and I wouldn't want to have it any other way. —                                      This quote right here is something I feel so strongly about, and I hope that others who read this book, who haven’t embraced their own gross sex goblin side, get a chance to see that there’s nothing to be ashamed or guilty over for engaging in what gets the loins goin’.                                      I have a lot of notes, and my gremlin brain is going crazy because this review won’t get anywhere if I choose to go into each annotation. Zachary Zane spoke about things that I don’t see quite often, or if I do, it tends to leave a sour taste in my mouth. From talking about the weird things we’d do as kids or the sexual guilt we can feel growing up, or how we have to stop the shame around STIs, Zane manages to keep you invested as well as making you feel like you’re in a gaff having four am banter with a close mate.                                      One of the big mains the book focuses on is bisexuality, which I’m not gonna sit and explain because it’s 2023 and that ain’t my job anymore, especially that this book does it fifty times better than me & it also even opened my eyes to my own sexuality as a queer trans man who’s sexuality seems to be ever changing.                                      But in cumclusion, Boyslut is a highly positive book that delves into deeper subjects than I wasn’t expecting and has even made me question some of my own behaviours and feelings & can’t recommend enough if you want a good queer nonfiction book.

You know it’s gonna be good when you’re already highlighting sections in the Foreword.                                       Boyslut                                      by Zachary Zane is an unabashed, wild and emotional journey, tackling sexual shame with a full body slam and putting the audience in a chokehold (it’s okay; we like it). It’s a brutally honest manifesto, a sexual history that reclaims power and puts desire front and center.                                       Boyslut                                      isn’t for those easily offended, though the shock value of the language wears off as it becomes normal, even aspirational. Still, it was a lot to take in and process and I felt at times overwhelmed, overjoyed and a little depressed (sometimes all three at once).                                      Zane, a self–proclaimed Boyslut, wasn’t always this way, and we’re whisked through a lifetime of anxiety, fumbles, and questions. As relatable as many of them are, and as much as Zane consistently urges the reader to do what is best for them, I couldn’t help but feel that the book was in some ways contributing to the very thing it fights against. The LGBTQIA+ community is built on people being ashamed of themselves, of fear of rejection, of confusion and loneliness and the search for some kind of belonging. Plenty of that comes from the outside, but plenty of it comes from the inside, within the community. I wish I could feel the level of confidence that Zane has, could harness it and ride it all the way home, but I don’t know how. And reading this book made me feel like there’s just another unattainable standard I have to live up to to be the right kind of gay.                                      But that’s not Zane’s job to fix, and so I want to be careful placing a burden on him that doesn’t belong there. This memoir is so many things - it’s education, it’s community, it’s the advice of a friend, the encouragement to look within and start unpacking all those dusty boxes to move them out. I laughed the whole time. We need way more of this sex-positive liberation and uninhibited discourse about anything and everything. It’s hard to be vulnerable, to hold nothing back, to share the most tender parts of ourselves. If there’s one thing that binds us together, it’s that while we all may not walk the exact same path, we’ve all grappled with ourselves as different and are all in some stage of accepting what is. That lived experience is universal, and brings us closer, makes that belonging much more tangible. Maybe being a Boyslut is a state of mind, an endeavor to fight for, as impossible as it seems. And while I don’t think I’m a Boyslut yet, I’m happy to count one (or many) among my friends.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated LGBTQ+ Book of the Year by Buzzfeed                              A sex and relationship columnist bares it all in a series of essays—part memoir, part manifesto—that explore the author’s coming-of-age and coming out as a bisexual man and move toward embracing and celebrating sex unencumbered by shame                              As a boy, Zachary Zane sensed that all was not right when images of his therapist naked popped into his head.

Zane is uniquely placed as a queer, bi, poly man to take us through that journey.                                      A particular insight that spoke to me what his view that compersion and jealousy are not opposite emotions but can and often do coexist together. Think this will help me in my journey!                                      However, while he does try to be aware of and call out his privilege as a white cis, straight-sized man he doesn't fully overcome it. For instance when he says that size doesn't stop you having all the sex you want because he happily hooks up with men of all body sizes it isn't the reality out there for a lot of larger men.                                      There is also a limitation in the book that each topic isn't touched on so deeply - to do so would give each chapter its own book. However it does leave a lot of room for misunderstandings to continue over what it means to be poly (many different things, actually) and only a brief mention of U=U in HIV treatment in a footnote. I think Zane writes from a place of very good intention with an assumption of good faith on behalf of the reader but it would have been good for some of these topics to be given some more lines to ensure there was no room for not understanding the message.                                      Zane is witty, it was a pleasant and interesting read which got several literal LOLs out of me (sorry to my row mates on the flights I read it on). Overall the world is a better place for this book existing within it, I think.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated LGBTQ+ Book of the Year by Buzzfeed                              A sex and relationship columnist bares it all in a series of essays—part memoir, part manifesto—that explore the author’s coming-of-age and coming out as a bisexual man and move toward embracing and celebrating sex unencumbered by shame                              As a boy, Zachary Zane sensed that all was not right when images of his therapist naked popped into his head.

You’ll finish needing a cold shower and at the same time, feeling open to more sex-positive thinking in your everyday, and maybe even feeling more affirmed in being a bislut (whether practicing or aspiring).

I did get a little frustrated when the book felt it leaned more on the manifesto than the memoir aspect, feeling like it got a bit repetitive at points. Using more narrative to make a point could have been a better technique than another paragraph about the same thing discussed mere pages before. Given the vast amount of sex stories Zane could pull from, I found it strange that the book seemed to lack much of these personal accounts.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated LGBTQ+ Book of the Year by Buzzfeed                              A sex and relationship columnist bares it all in a series of essays—part memoir, part manifesto—that explore the author’s coming-of-age and coming out as a bisexual man and move toward embracing and celebrating sex unencumbered by shame                              As a boy, Zachary Zane sensed that all was not right when images of his therapist naked popped into his head.

Now I normally am not a memoir person, I just cannot find ones that intrigue me. But this one was exceptional! I loved every moment of it. As a bisexual myself, it was nice to see a memoir by a fellow bisexual because I knew I would be able to relate more to this memoir in particular. Zane's use of humor made the memoir very enjoyable and easier to understand what message he was trying to get across. His personal stories were also picked out well to illustrate what he was trying to show the reader.                                      I will say this, I am also nonbinary. And Zane's addition constanly throughout the book that bisexuality does not exclude us nonbinary folk in that attraction range made me feel seen in a way I have not had much of since my coming out. It was a pleasant surprise, but important to include. I also valued the insight into polyamorous relationships.                                      Finally I would like to say that as someone who is somewhat on the asexual spectrum, but also has this intense fear of intimacy, I no longer feel as afraid after reading this. I feel more comfortable and able to take things at my pace. It has gotten rid of some of this shame and unkowing that I have lived with my entire life. A perfect read for anyone in the queer community as well as those with sexual shame.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated LGBTQ+ Book of the Year by Buzzfeed                              A sex and relationship columnist bares it all in a series of essays—part memoir, part manifesto—that explore the author’s coming-of-age and coming out as a bisexual man and move toward embracing and celebrating sex unencumbered by shame                              As a boy, Zachary Zane sensed that all was not right when images of his therapist naked popped into his head.

I had hoped to save this book for a holiday vacation read but I couldn't put it down once I opened it. I laughed; I cried; I got aroused. As someone who reads marketing messages all day, it was refreshing to see how honest, open and yes-at times-vulgar Zachary was at expressing himself.                                      With a focus on sex-positivity and pleasure, I've seen a lot of sex-forward and queer books come across my desk. I haven't read anything like what Zane has accomplished with BoySlut. There are books that center on female pleasure, and books about breaking down the spectrum of queerdom, but BoySlut is the first I've seen where men are encouraged to be who they are despite what society and status quo has to say about it and act on the desires that come with it.                                      Readers get a chance to discover LGBTQ+ experiences and learn the lessons of Polyamory through Zachary's experiences without having to download Grindr themselves (though Zane has tips for them if they do).                                      For those who are still figuring out where they lie on the LGBTQIA+ and open-relationships spectrums, BoySlut is a must read for that journey.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated LGBTQ+ Book of the Year by Buzzfeed                              A sex and relationship columnist bares it all in a series of essays—part memoir, part manifesto—that explore the author’s coming-of-age and coming out as a bisexual man and move toward embracing and celebrating sex unencumbered by shame                              As a boy, Zachary Zane sensed that all was not right when images of his therapist naked popped into his head.

In Boyslut, Zachary Zane gives everyone permission to be their complicated, messy, perverted selves. Not only will Boyslut cement Zane's reputation as ""bicon,"" but he just made every single bi person, myself included, feel a lot better about the often complicated and misunderstood sexual identity. But this book isn't just for bi folks. It's for everyone who wants a raw, bold, and, yes, at times, unapologetically problematic read in an era when too many queer memoirs are scrubbed clean of their exquisite dirt and graphic slime (or in Zane's case, vomit). Prepare for perspectives on porn, addiction, and condom use that you've never read before (even if you may have secretly thought about it). As a sex writer myself, even if I don't identify with everything Zane writes, I can't put down this page-turner, honor his place as a bicon, and can't wait for the cultural impact of Bloyslut to unfold.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated LGBTQ+ Book of the Year by Buzzfeed                              A sex and relationship columnist bares it all in a series of essays—part memoir, part manifesto—that explore the author’s coming-of-age and coming out as a bisexual man and move toward embracing and celebrating sex unencumbered by shame                              As a boy, Zachary Zane sensed that all was not right when images of his therapist naked popped into his head.

As soon as I saw the cover, with its lurid, glossy, almost Warhol-esque lollipop front and center serving as the big O in the brazen title, I knew I had found a kindred spirit, for sure. Not only am I unashamed of my own high body count when it comes to partners (though nowhere near author Zachary Zane’s count), but a memoir/manifesto about being a “boyslut” written by a man? Sign me up. We’ve seen several memoirs and autobiographies from female porn stars and sex writers over the past decade…so why not a man? I was absolutely fascinated about seeing the slutty side of life through the eyes of a man.                                      I have to own up to not knowing who the heck Zachary Zane is before I read this book. I went in blind. It’s not like I read Men’s Health magazine or am very keyed into the who’s who of the LGBTQ+ writer’s circle. So I didn’t know Zachary Zane was a prolific sex advice columnist, essayist, advocate, speaker, and activist. I didn’t know he was bisexual and polyamorous (something we have in common). And I didn’t know he was younger than me (though I shouldn’t be surprised). I also didn’t know how blunt and crass he was going to be, but I was here for it!                                      The book is divided into four parts: Sexual Shame, Sexual Confusion, Sexual Security, and Sexual Pride. Each part is then broken down into chapters (it’s set up that way, but it feels more like a series of essays grouped together to fit a theme and that theme makes up the “part”) has a complete story arc unto itself, whether it be about how Grindr has affected the LGBTQ+ community to why people are so bad at handling rejection. This makes the book easy to read in pieces, if you feel the need to put the book down or if you need to take a break. The only downside to this format (at least in the eARC I read), is that Zane has a tendency to resort to asterisks and daggers to denote that he’s alluding to something that isn’t included in the main text but can be found at the end of the chapter. The issue is, since he used the same symbol (usually more than five times in each chapter), you end up going back through the chapter and trying to match up the asterisk or dagger with the remark at the end of the chapter. It got very old, very fast. (Please note: If this issue has changed or has been rectified in some way in the print edition or published ebook version then please ignore this part of my review, as some formatting changes can occur between the version provided to early reviewers and the final, published version).                                      While I loved this book as a whole for its humor, insight, compassion, brashness, courage, empathy, education, and honesty, I can recognize that a cisgendered bisexual white Gen X woman isn’t the target audience for this book. Zane himself is a Millennial, and it’s evident by the colloquialisms, vernacular, and pop culture references sprinkled liberally throughout the book that the target demographic he and the publishers are shooting for are other Millennials, Gen-Zs, and lower. I’d argue that’s okay. That’s even great. I’m up to date enough on pop culture and the other terms that I didn’t feel confused or out of touch, but I could see how other people my age might be, if they aren’t the type of people to listen to Charli XCX and Kim Petras and binge Drag Race.                                      This book can be a touch chaotic, but I think the value it holds as a memoir, a teaching tool, and maybe even a literary friend when you think you’re all alone in the world and questioning your sexuality and/or identity is far more important than how it’s put together. It’s relatable, funny, impassioned, and honest. So, even though I know this book wasn’t written with me in mind, I know it’s perfect for a whole lot of people out of there who really need to read what Zachary Zane has to say.

Boyslut- Part memoir, part advice, part Manifesto, does a brilliant job of pushing aside any leftover sexual shame the reader may feel, but essentially getting straight into it.                                      I love Zach's style of writing throughout this book, with plenty of good-sized chapters and sections to split up certain big subjects. I was happy to see this isn't a seriously written book, with plenty of humour, and it has a voice like Zachary is sitting next to you, sharing his views and spilling some dirty stories and jokes.                                      I loved that from the get-go, bisexuality in both men and women was spoken about, but that bisexuality in men was discussed in detail, I enjoyed a couple of paragraphs talking about how as a bi person...How do others know unless we tell them? If you're in a same-sex relationship, it's gay, if you're in an opposite-sex relationship, it's straight, the only way to know would be in a poly relationship with men and women! Bi visibility sucks, even now!!                                      Chapter 8 was probably my favourite, as this is broken up into questions asked by people when they find out you're bisexual, then the answer Zach gave them when asked, and what he would say now. The questions are ones I'm pretty sure every bi person has heard, even stupid ones that haven't got anything to do with your sexuality, but I think it just gives me that sense of not being alone. (And that some people are fucking stupid.)                                      Questioning sexuality is a big thing too, and I'm glad it's covered in such a way to make people who find themselves in that situation, comfortable and like they are valid too. To be honest I think the major takeaway from this book is that your feelings towards your sexuality, and sex in general are all valid.                                      I found the pros and cons of Grindr super interesting. As someone who hasn't used a dating app before, and has of course never ventured onto Grindr, I thought it was super fascinating how it works and doesn't work for people.                                      There was just one thing I found that wasn't what I would call useful, and that was a few sentences about STIs and safe sex. I think no one should be ashamed of getting STIs, it happens. But I wouldn't say that we should all be celebrating them in a way of saying 'I'm so happy I have tonnes of sex' which is kind of how it's written, strangely.

This gets at, I think, something akin to the ""sensus divinitatis"" of the scholastics, but in a less inherently theological manner, focusing less on the existence of ""a god"" as personal being and more about the divine sense of Law/guilt and of Gospel/Forgiveness.                                      It's also interesting to note that this comes very close to the form of ""theology"" described by Paul Tillich, the divorcing of the language of these things from the inherently theological to the psychological and social aspects of humanity. It's also interesting to me that Zane spoke of this ""absolution"" as he calls it, in the exact same way that Tillich did, which is as affirmation of the self as it is.                                      While I don't agree with any of this myself, I do think it's interesting to see, whether Zane is aware of it or not the echoing similarities between an atheistic LGBT author and liberal Lutheran theology.                                      There are however, together both with Zane and tillich things that I would see as the failure of the sensus divinitatis to bring us to the truth in actuality. I.e.; guilt for both Zane and tillich before him ends up getting chalked up to mental illness or trauma or some other form of distortion of reality (essentially the notion that something is wrong is seen as an illusion of the personal or impersonal enemy of creation), and the ""absolution"" is defined not as forgiveness for actual wrong, but following the former definition, it is seen instead as affirmation of the good that is believed to actually already be.                                      Thus; the modus operandi for Zanes law/gospel paradigm would be done worry nothings wrong with you, you're great.

I'm a former (although I think one is always a boy-slut, no matter the age, we just live it out in our memories and fantasies now), I was eager to read about wild orgies, anonymous sexual encounters and all that the title hints at.                                      This is not to say there weren't some illuminating, sexual revelations from the author (and let me stop here to say I follow him on Instagram and he's totally hot, totally someone I'd do without hesitation). He did provide some of his personal sexual history (he's bi-sexual, and I hope I used the right term with the hyphen), and he did disclose quite publicly one of his kinks (and one that I find totally unappealing, but I get it...we all have our kinks).                                      The author is currently one of the leading reporters on sex and men's health and what I did appreciate about this book was the frank discussion on sex and how we get screwed up in knots about what sex should be. That we're not 'normal' if we like a little kink (I won't say 'weird' because that implies there's something wrong with our desire). I truly appreciated, though I'm still as confused as ever, his delineation of sexual fluidity: cis, bi, gay, fray, poly, monogamous, and on and on. It's a confusing world out there in Sexland. There was a lightbulb that went on when he discussed 'fraysexual'. I knew that I could apply this term to myself.                                      I have ventured out there in the sexual world and I can honestly say, I have no regrets and no thoughts about 'Oh, I wish I'd done that.' There is one thing I haven't done, and it's not for lack of trying and I'm kind of hoping this book allowed me to let go of whatever deep issue might be preventing me from checking this experience off my list.                                      So thanks, Zachary Zane, and if you're ever venturing into rural Iowa, there's a guy who'd love to play with you someday.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated LGBTQ+ Book of the Year by Buzzfeed                              A sex and relationship columnist bares it all in a series of essays—part memoir, part manifesto—that explore the author’s coming-of-age and coming out as a bisexual man and move toward embracing and celebrating sex unencumbered by shame                              As a boy, Zachary Zane sensed that all was not right when images of his therapist naked popped into his head.

I'm also glad he has a platform to recount his experiences as a bisexual person, to give that group some visibility.                                      I have a problem with some of the arguments he makes, though. When discussing racial preferences, his advice is essentially, ""If they don't realize you don't want to have sex with their entire race, it's okay."" On page 117, he writes, ""For example, you don't have to tell someone you're not interested in their entire race as a respone to a 'hi' from a rando hottie on Grindr. You can simply say, 'You're super cute, but I'm not looking.'"" He doesn't encourage the reader to ask themselves how the media has portrayed people of that race, if they have ever interacted with someone of that race in a meaningful way, etc. It's just, ""Here's a phrase you can use to reject them.""                                      In contrast, when discussing the judgment he feels about his decision to have unprotected sex, he spends pages explaining why the AIDS epidemic, gay bashing, and a variety of other historical factors justify his decision. On page 163, he writes, ""So, when you shame someone for getting an STI, you're engaging in a lot of other shaming that you'd (I hope) likely think you're too wise to fall for: sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, and racism."" It's like he only wants to bring cultural and historical context to bear when it helps him justify what he wants to do anyway.                                      Finally, the author repeatedly gets irritated when other people have emotions. He chastises people for ""freaking out"" over an STI, being sad that he doesn't want to date them, or honestly sharing about depression when the author wants to get laid. Even if someone's emotions are not logical or useful . . . neither is your irritation about those emotions.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated LGBTQ+ Book of the Year by Buzzfeed                              A sex and relationship columnist bares it all in a series of essays—part memoir, part manifesto—that explore the author’s coming-of-age and coming out as a bisexual man and move toward embracing and celebrating sex unencumbered by shame                              As a boy, Zachary Zane sensed that all was not right when images of his therapist naked popped into his head.

Equal parts personal narrative and social commentary, Boyslut is Zane's answer to the lack of media addressing the needs of male sexuality. In this entertaining and illuminating collection of essays, Zane seeks to remove the shame that many men experience surrounding their sexual desires, especially those felt by Queer, Bi, and Pan men. However, one does not need to be queer or male to benefit from the wisdom imparted in these pages; at its core, Boyslut is a clarion call to the masses to embrace their sexuality and explore their desires free of stigma regardless of gender or orientation.                                      A forewarning for the faint of heart and the prude, this book is not for you, or maybe you could benefit the most from its message. The book contains graphic descriptions of sexual activity between all genders and frequently uses profane and reclaimed language. I absolutely loved this book and will carry the lessons learned between its pages with me as I go forward in my sexual journey. That being said, not everyone will agree with Zane's message, and some portions are likely to cause controversy, such as his relaxed position on condoms. But as clearly stated in the title, this is his manifesto, his outlook alone, and readers are encouraged to find their journey and to engage in behavior that feels comfortable to them. Again this book is about removing the shame around sex, including the shame that some might feel about needing extra precautions to feel safe during sexual encounters.                                      Disclosure: I received a complimentary ARC of this book through Netgalley. My review is my honest opinion.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","Named a Most Anticipated LGBTQ+ Book of the Year by Buzzfeed                              A sex and relationship columnist bares it all in a series of essays—part memoir, part manifesto—that explore the author’s coming-of-age and coming out as a bisexual man and move toward embracing and celebrating sex unencumbered by shame                              As a boy, Zachary Zane sensed that all was not right when images of his therapist naked popped into his head.

The Positives: I really enjoyed the candidness around sexuality and it was written in way that felt very open and honest in first person POV. There was also some good insight on things that some people don't like to talk about like the complexities of bottoming, the risk of STi's when you're sexually active and the hunger that comes with being single and looking to get laid as much as you can. I also love any type of LGBTQ+ representation so the fact that this was a book with a Bi viewpoint was a plus.                                      The cons: It felt like the same point was being beaten over and over again and in an almost non-inclusive way? It is the authors manifesto about bi visibility and to be fair that point of view was the focus but it was almost dismissive to people who chose to ""conform"" to ""normative"" relationships Sure there are many pros about being poly, ENM and open relationships but for those who choose to be monogamous, they're written as archaic close-minded squares who are better off leaning into the new wave of relationships lest they be cheated on any minute now. While trying to express his own identity there were lots of things that were brushed aside as less then, including almost writing off the idea of being cautious with contracting STI's because rubber impedes the author to cum.                                      Whether you love it or feel some kind of way about it, Boyslut will make you laugh, think and question intent which in the end, a book like this succeeded in doing.

And remember: I am not here to judge your drag, I mean your book. Books are art and art is subjective. These are just my personal thoughts. They are not meant to be taken as broader commentary on the general quality of the work. Believe me, I have not enjoyed many an excellent book, and my individual lack of enjoyment has not made any of those books less excellent or (more relevantly) less successful.                                      Further disclaimer: Readers, please stop accusing me of trying to take down “my competition” because I wrote a review you didn’t like. This is complete nonsense. Firstly, writing isn’t a competitive sport. Secondly, I only publish reviews of books in the subgenre where I’m best known (queer romcom) if I have good things to say. And finally: taking time out of my life to read an entire book and then write a GR review about it would be a profoundly inefficient and ineffective way to damage the careers of other authors. If you can’t credit me with simply being a person who loves books and likes talking about them, at least credit me with enough common sense to be a better villain.                                      *******************************************                                      Oh Gawd, I should probably have realised this earlier but … it’s really hard to review memoirs. Not least because it feels perilously close to reviewing a person. Did they lay themselves bare entertainingly enough? Was their life relevant enough to mine to engage me? Power dynamics that become even complex when the person in question is already marginalised compared to you. To say nothing of the fact that we’re at a cultural place right now that seems determined to strip trans people of their voices, their access to medical care, their basic fucking selfhood. In any case—doing my best to put all that aside and talk about the book as a book—this is a timely, engaging, genuinely excellent piece of memoir writing. So much so that I did get close to the end of think and think how in God’s name is this man only twenty-six. Because I was a fucking idiot at twenty-six. And this is incredibly measured, insightful … and kind of, you know. Wise even? How.                                      Rather than going full David Copperfield—from ‘I am born’ to ‘I am twenty-six’—A Trans Man Walks Into A Gay Bar is rather more thematic: by focusing on particular experiences from the author’s life, it takes the opportunity to discuss them culturally as well as personally. Although I should also say that Nicholas is always careful to emphasise that his experiences are his own, strongly informed by his perspective as a white, relatively affluent, publicly passing binary trans man, and should not be taken as universal.                                      I honestly feel somewhat inadequate in my attempt to do justice to this book. If you look at almost any review that isn’t mine, you’ll see people talking about how it spoke to them very directly or made them feel seen in a way they hadn’t felt before, or articulated something that they hadn’t quite managed to articulate for themselves. I think it’s those type of responses that speak not only to how necessary this book is—especially right now—but also to how effectively Nicholas communicates his life story, his ideas, and his perspective. For my own part, I found the book intensely moving, as well thought-provoking. Not, I hasten to add, because it’s a trauma narrative. It goes to some fairly dark places with candour and courage, but Nicholas is as articulate when it comes to celebrating trans joy as he is at expressing trans pain:                                       For me, transitioning was more about coming home. It was the biggest act of self-care and self-love I have ever been able to give myself.                                      The other aspect of a A Trans Man Walks Into A Gay Bar that I personally found really admirable was the way Nicholas uses his experiences—as a gay man, as a trans man, as a gay trans man, and as someone who once presented as and was perceived differently—to retain a multiplicity of perspectives. This is complicated to talk about because—in the UK at least—there tends to be a singular narrative of transness that is treated as “correct” i.e. that if you’re “really” trans, you must always have known, your aim is for your gender presentation to mimic cis norms as closely as possible, you must experience dysphoria, you must seek medical intervention up to and including surgery, that transition itself means one thing, and that having transitioned anything and everything that happened to you previously becomes either irrelevant or unspeakable.                                      And obviously some (or all) of these things might be true for some people. But something Nicholas is very open (and eloquent) about is the value all his experiences hold for him, even the negative ones, and even the ones that belong to a part of his life that certain cultural narratives tell him he must abandon or otherwise disavow:                                       My trans body is meaningful. It is what separates me from being a cisgender man. It means I have a difference and a history that is unlike cisgender men. I wouldn’t be the man I am today if I hadn’t lived 18 years of my life as a woman. I’m proud of my difference.                                      I can’t—and, frankly, shouldn’t—make claims about whether this book will speak to you. It did, however, speak to me. It spoke to me quite profoundly. Because you don’t have to directly share Nicholas’s identity (or all aspects of his identity) for the things he discusses—queerness, gender, bodies, self-worth, society, love, sex—to be meaningful or relevant to you. In fact, I kind of think maybe if you feel those things *aren’t* meaningful or relevant to you, then you are probably as much in need of this book as the people for whom (some of) Nicholas’s experiences may be directly familiar. The fact is, trans rights are human rights; by demonising, othering or pathologising trans people we are ultimately just harming ourselves. Because, as this book illustrates time and time again, kyriarchy, patriarchy, heteronormativity, gender essentialism, hurt everyone, not equally certainly, but the more we trap ourselves in a society that trammels identity, or rejects the humanity of others, the worse that society becomes for everyone.                                       I wondered whether this was just what being gay was– trying to find warmth in cold places. Trying to make ourselves comfortable in the little space we have. All squished together in our tiny boxes, looking but not really seeing the people around us. I wondered if we as gay men realized, or cared, that it could be so soulless, or if that was just something we’d had to become accustomed to, or perhaps we hadn’t known anything different.                                      In his prologue to the book, Nicholas, echoing Shon Faye in The Transgender Issue, notes the long-standing pressure on trans people to offer their stories to the world in order to have their voices heard. There is an undeniable vulnerability—the sort of vulnerability that always comes with honesty—to A Trans Man Walks Into A Gay Bar. But along with that vulnerability comes strength, conviction, compassion, and insight. I hope someday we can get to a place where we can listen to trans voices without also demanding this kind of vulnerability. For now, though, Nicholas has taken the lessons learned from figuring out how to live his life on his own terms to tell his story on them too.                                      And I really cannot recommend it highly enough.","223 pages, Paperback                             First published May 18, 2023","‘On the bookshelves, there was plenty of stuff on being gay, and much needed, joyous accounts of what it is to be trans, but nothing really that encapsulates what is it to be both – to exist in the hazy terrain between.’                              After his relationship with his girlfriend of 5 years ended, Harry realised he was a single adult for the first time – not only that, but a single, transmasculine and newly out gay man.

Harry's deeply personal account of what it means to be trans and gay resonated with me so much. i loved reading about his experiences and the thoughts and fears he had while going through them. i only cried like fifteen times (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠)                                      i also liked how he didn't just share his own account but also made references to current events and even cited sources (it's the academic in me, don't interact).                                      i think there are more and more books, especially fiction, coming out these days that feature trans characters that are also gay which suggests that the notion that trans people transition to be ""straight"" is slowly receiving pushback. that being said, i think sharing real life experiences about navigating gay spaces as a trans person is really important, not only for fellow trans people to feel less alone in their worries and fears but it's also something that the rest of the LGBTQ community needs to be aware of - let's be real here, a lot of gay spaces do exclusively cater to cis people and can be quite toxic when you don't conform to what it means to be a man ™ in their eyes.                                      i do highly recommend this book to fellow trans friends but especially to everyone who is cis - otherwise queer or not. it's very well written, easy to read, and very important in this day and age.                                       i received an arc via edelweiss, all opinions are my own","223 pages, Paperback                             First published May 18, 2023","‘On the bookshelves, there was plenty of stuff on being gay, and much needed, joyous accounts of what it is to be trans, but nothing really that encapsulates what is it to be both – to exist in the hazy terrain between.’                              After his relationship with his girlfriend of 5 years ended, Harry realised he was a single adult for the first time – not only that, but a single, transmasculine and newly out gay man.

He makes it very clear that this is a book about his personal experiences and it isn’t meant to represent all gay or trans men. While this is mostly focused on Harry’s own story he does also bring in queer and trans history in certain sections. And he also brings in more modern news stories of experiences of other queer and/or trans people.                                      I appreciated that while he does write about some of his own more difficult moments, or transphobia and homophobia in the news, this book as a whole is not about trauma. There are plenty of stories about joy and moments of euphoria.                                      The book isn’t written in a fully chronological way, it’s more focused around each chapter being about a different topic or theme. In the beginning I felt like I was just thrown into the book and wasn’t finding out enough about Harry as a person, just learning about experiences he was having. As it went on I settled more into the book, but I feel like I would have benefitted from the book being chronological so it would be easier to follow his progress and journey.                                      Overall I think this is an interesting memoir that details experiences that I haven’t seen much representation for in books. Definitely check it out if it sounds interesting to you.

That I’m able to read about another gay trans man’s experiences and see myself reflected in them - moments like ‘YES I’ve had this thought so many times’ and ‘oh, I really want this in my future’. The author wrote this book with exactly this in mind - not being able to find almost any books by and about gay trans men - and I am very glad that he did.                                      This book is very meaningful to me on a personal level as a trans person, but in general, the way it is written is also very accessible to cis people looking to read more about being trans. The author does a very good job at presenting important trans issues as well as trans & queer culture and history throughout, in a way that feels very personal but still informative.                                      Sections that stood out to me the most were the author’s relationship to water as a gay trans man, the whole issue surrounding healthcare and how even non-trans-specific healthcare can be a huge problem for trans people, and also the “but who will love you?” section (because which trans person hasn’t been asked that by their parents).                                      “Lou Sullivan [a gay trans activist] is quoted as saying, ‘I wanna look like what I am but I don’t know what someone like me looks like’. It’s been 32 years since his death date, and I am starting to see what people who are gay and trans look like, and I’m able to imagine endless possibilities of what we could be in the future. But in the meantime, I’m still searching for people like me.”                                      (Thank you to NetGalley and Jessica Kingsley publishers for an ARC of this book - it genuinely meant a lot to me).","223 pages, Paperback                             First published May 18, 2023","‘On the bookshelves, there was plenty of stuff on being gay, and much needed, joyous accounts of what it is to be trans, but nothing really that encapsulates what is it to be both – to exist in the hazy terrain between.’                              After his relationship with his girlfriend of 5 years ended, Harry realised he was a single adult for the first time – not only that, but a single, transmasculine and newly out gay man.

I want to thank Harry Nicholas and Jessica Kingsley Publishers for the opportunity to access an eARC of this book.                                      The thing that sold me on this book was the cover (gorgeous and eye-catching colours, well chosen font choice and photo) and the title (clever and sets the whole mood for the tone and themes of this book, honestly, it’s genius). The designer deserves recognition!                                      Onto the contents! Now, I’m hesitant to read a lot of trans biographies and memoirs, especially as this year I decided to steer away from ‘trans trauma’ narratives. Often the trans narrative is focused solely on our trauma - on the abuse and exclusion and pain we all suffer at one point or another (weekly, daily, even hourly).                                      While this narrative is important to bring awareness to, it can also be dangerous - and is the main (if only) genre of any trans narrative, fiction or non-fiction. Being trans is so much more than, and honestly, not even about, pain. It’s about joy - joy in our gender euphoria, our discovery of ourselves, what makes us happy, how we WANT to live and feel, be seen, and express ourselves as.                                      I say all this to praise this book, because Harry, while of course discussing the trauma and pain he has encountered, focuses mainly on the joy and rhythm of his journey. His ups and downs, his smiles and sorrows, all while his main goal is to educate and tie each anecdote to a current or pressing issue. Just as with everyone, the sorrows of his life are always companions to fun, wild, dangerous, and fulfilling experiences.                                      His humor never misses, nor does it feel shoved in as an afterthought to lighten a harrowing moment. Instead, Harry flawlessly navigates the complicated and nuanced flood of emotions so well that no moment is ever the ‘trauma’ moment or the ‘happy’ moment. That just doesn't exist in life. We FEEL so much in each second. Yet he’s able to convey these without complication or overbearance.                                      If I could wish for changes, (especially as Harry wrote this book because he could not find books on this very topic (being a gay trans man in gay spaces)) I would have loved him to offer tips and advice on things he’s learned in a summary of each section. What should one prepare for and take to a gay bar? How can one take safety precautions on a date? What are the social rules and practices of a gay sauna? What can you do to prepare for transphobia on a date? Mind you, a lot of advice is given during or after anecdotes, but I, being a list person, would have appreciated some bullet-point summaries at the end.                                      During the section on the issues around ‘passing’ (which was brilliantly done, don’t get me wrong) he failed to mention how it affects androgynous presenting trans folk (such as myself), intersex people and trans folk who happily present as the gender they are assigned at birth but are another gender entirely. Passing isn’t even an option for some of us (some don’t want to) and some (like me) who won’t ever get the option in their lifetime. That’s honestly a large portion of our trans population that got left out of this discussion.                                      Lastly, this is another (as far as I’ve been able to tell) book from a white perspective. Harry does mention the need to listen to and be aware of BIPOC trans folk, but I felt that a lot of Harry’s experiences were grounded in the safety of whiteness. It limits how well this book could help BIPOC trans men looking for the book Harry set out to make. It is helpful to white folks, sure, but leaves out much needed help to our trans BIPOC siblings. I’d love for this same book to be written from a Black, Indigenous or Takatāpui lens.                                      Overall, I do rate this a 4.5 for white readers - as it will help them. For non-white readers, I’m not qualified to rate, but I will suggest it leaves out critical information and help for them (but I implore we listen to BIPOC reviewers always in this area rather than myself).","223 pages, Paperback                             First published May 18, 2023","‘On the bookshelves, there was plenty of stuff on being gay, and much needed, joyous accounts of what it is to be trans, but nothing really that encapsulates what is it to be both – to exist in the hazy terrain between.’                              After his relationship with his girlfriend of 5 years ended, Harry realised he was a single adult for the first time – not only that, but a single, transmasculine and newly out gay man.

This memoir is an absolutely essential addition to modern literature. As Nicholas states, there are opportunities to read about gay experiences or trans experiences, but rarely both at once. In the political moment we are living through currently, it is so important to listen to and promote queer voices - especially trans ones.                                      Nicholas’ different ways of identifying throughout his life offers a multitude of perspectives. This is actually incredibly rare and makes his story even more precious. He makes very clear that there is no one universal trans experience, nor even one universal gay trans experience. He writes consistently eloquently and rightfully celebrates the unique joy that being gay and trans brings to his life.                                      I think this book offers one of the most powerful counter-arguments to the commonly heralded transphobic view that trans people are just confused homosexuals. After dealing with a pretty vitriolic rant from my own uncle over Easter, where I was accused of being a homophobe (despite him being completely unaware of my sexuality) and a traitor to my own gender (by a man of all people) for supporting trans rights, this book came at a perfect time for me. As a cisgender person, Nicholas’ reflections have given me a higher level of understanding and further ways in which I can defend trans people when I come across anti-trans rhetoric.                                      I am sure this book must be extremely affirming for those who can see parts of themselves in Nicholas’ story, especially those that are also both gay and trans. Its publication is so necessary for the world right now and will bring about so much good. The author does make a point that society often pressures trans people to tell their personal stories and traumas to be taken seriously. The book offers hope that we will be able to move past this, but for now provides an honest insight into a gay trans man in his 20s just trying to figure out this crazy thing called life.                                      Nicholas focuses on specific events or periods in his life in each chapter. This format did make the narrative a bit jumpy as it was not chronological. It also became slightly repetitive at points, as many of the threads came back to the same core message at the end of each section. Still the importance of this book makes these into very minor issues in the grand scheme of things.                                      Do you really want to know where I was April 29th? Speeding through this book in a day. I think it is an absolutely solid debut. Sources are cited properly and Nicholas makes good use of references to trans history and contemporary debates. The author is wise beyond his years at 26 and I can’t wait to see what he does in the future.                                      3.5/5","223 pages, Paperback                             First published May 18, 2023","‘On the bookshelves, there was plenty of stuff on being gay, and much needed, joyous accounts of what it is to be trans, but nothing really that encapsulates what is it to be both – to exist in the hazy terrain between.’                              After his relationship with his girlfriend of 5 years ended, Harry realised he was a single adult for the first time – not only that, but a single, transmasculine and newly out gay man.

Overall, Harry seems like a lovely guy who I would like to have a chat with, and I found myself wishing that his book would go a little deeper. My favourite essay was “The Ponds” because I think it traced a beautiful and profound connection between queer history and his own embodiment specifically as it relates to swimming and water, and I wanted more of that insight to be present throughout the other essays. There were also some editing and syntax errors that distracted me throughout. I’m glad that this book exists as an honest, contemporary account and I wish Harry the best!

2023-07-03,A Trans Man Walks Into a Gay Bar,,Harry  Nicholas,4.24,"['Queer', 'Nonfiction', 'LGBT', 'Memoir', 'Transgender', 'Adult', 'Biography']",Kindle $9.99,James Cooper,Rating 5 out of 5,"March 28, 2023","4.75 ⭐️                                      Thank you to NetGalley and Jessica Kingsley Publishers for accepting me to be a pre-publication reviewer of this memoir.                                      Disclaimer: I don’t identify as a trans person (honestly very unsure but right now I’m comfortable using the label cisgender) so I would recommend readings reviews by transgender people. However, this memoir equally talks about being a gay man which I am.                                      I really did enjoy this book, I think Nicholas is really providing something that is lacking: a gay trans man’s story and discussion of his experiences. Throughout reading I learnt so much about both the trans and gay male experience, queer history, current affairs and lots more. Nicholas is a great storyteller having an effortless wit and likeness to his personality - the humour is never forced and throughout he injects the perfect level of nuance. How this memoir is set out is great, it’s not entirely linear with many sections cross-linking with others but do stick to the topic he is talking about. Personal anecdotes are intertwined with non-fiction like facts and statistics, he references articles, artwork, literature, social media figures and much more. It is certainly a multi-faceted book discussing many things that queer people deal with, he addresses the notion of ‘queer shame’ and the ongoing violence against our community, specifically the emerging transphobic rhetoric, but there is a beautiful exploration of the joy of being queer too. We have a dark past and still a long way to go but this book and Harry’s messages are so inspiring, centring on this notion of banding together which he puts so eloquently here: ‘…that's the epitome of LGBTQ+ pride and why the LGB and the T can never be torn apart. It's the same fight. It's about rejecting the prison of sexuality and gender that was inflicted on us without our consent and saying 'No, that does not fit me.' This fight is about freedom, escaping the barriers and systems that force us all down, and battling to live authentically away from binary, heteronormative structures. It's about being outsiders and owning it. It's about rejecting those who seek to control our authentic lives and dampen us down. Queerness is about creating a new space for us all.’ Don’t that make you wanna fight? I dunno but I just found that his words really spoke to me and this is a trend throughout this book. ‘Queer’ initially meant different or strange or odd and so we shouldn’t really be thriving to ‘fit in’ anymore and I totally fell in love with Nicholas’s philosophy I guess and how he’s learnt to become so much more comfortable in his body and place in society. He truly sounds like such an amazing person and I can only hope more good things come his way.                                      The subheading of this memoir is ‘a journey of self (and sexual) discovery’ and this is defiantly an accurate one. The author brings us along on a lot of his life events and pivotal events that has made him the human he is today. I think my favourite aspects was the self discovery but I also found the sex-focused topics very insightful too. As a trans gay man I believe he really showed us the beauty of how diverse and multi-faceted our community is. He is also white and British (and male ‘passing’) so has advantages that many people don’t, so a similar book by someone that is part of more sub-communities would be interesting to read of their experiences. That being said, I found a lot of what Nicholas wrote could be extended to other people in a similar position and was a great start and necessary book to fill a space.                                      This book is written really well and very engaging. I noted down many quotes and made VERY detailed notes on each topic but I won’t share these cause I want you to get the book. Nicholas also kindly provides the source of materials used and recommended reading at the end which I for sure will be checking out. I’ll leave you with a great quote from the start that reminds me we are and must remain a community that sticks together because ‘there is no one way to be gay, trans and queer. We are a million people under one beautiful, horrifyingly-large-if-slightly-misshapen rainbow umbrella.’","223 pages, Paperback                             First published May 18, 2023","‘On the bookshelves, there was plenty of stuff on being gay, and much needed, joyous accounts of what it is to be trans, but nothing really that encapsulates what is it to be both – to exist in the hazy terrain between.’                              After his relationship with his girlfriend of 5 years ended, Harry realised he was a single adult for the first time – not only that, but a single, transmasculine and newly out gay man.

A Trans Man Walks Into a Gay Bar is a sorely needed book right now, with all that’s going on and all the pointless animosity directed at the trans community by certain cohorts of the wider queer community. Nicholas explores queerness eloquently, unflinchingly, and holistically. I’m confident that any trans person who identifies as anything other than straight will see at least a sliver of their own experience reflected back at them, even if it’s in an unexpected way.                                      This is a collection of essays- a problem I occasionally have with books of this format is the disjointed feel they can have, but ATMWIaGB has a lovely through-line. When I first picked it up, I only intended to read the first couple of pages, and got halfway through the book before I turned out the light. Nicholas weaves his personal experiences with queer history and culture so seamlessly. He’s raw and honest, and all of those other things we usually say in praise of good memoirs.                                      It can be extremely isolating to be a trans person navigating their sexuality, now more than ever. ATMWIaGB is timely and honest- like an interesting chat with an (intelligent and well spoken!) queer friend in a coffee shop. I believe this book will make lots of people feel less alone, and for that quality I highly recommend it. It also seems like an approachable read for cis people, queer and straight alike, who might be interested in the spaces where gender and sexuality intersect.","223 pages, Paperback                             First published May 18, 2023","‘On the bookshelves, there was plenty of stuff on being gay, and much needed, joyous accounts of what it is to be trans, but nothing really that encapsulates what is it to be both – to exist in the hazy terrain between.’                              After his relationship with his girlfriend of 5 years ended, Harry realised he was a single adult for the first time – not only that, but a single, transmasculine and newly out gay man.

As someone who’s a part of the LGBTQ= space, but not trans, I learned so much about the experience of a trans gay man. Nicholas writes with such vulnerability. While I wish there were more moments where Nicholas overlapped his storytelling with informational inserts, I’m quite satisfied with this read. I believe the strongest element of Nicholas’ book is his voice. While serious topics and important questions came up, Nicholas was able to maneuver the conversation with honesty and a sense of humor. In a way, after reading, I felt like I knew Harry Nicholas personally.                                      Overall, I think this was a great read.

2023-07-03,A Trans Man Walks Into a Gay Bar,,Harry  Nicholas,4.24,"['Queer', 'Nonfiction', 'LGBT', 'Memoir', 'Transgender', 'Adult', 'Biography']",Kindle $9.99,Georgia T-S,Rating 4 out of 5,"March 15, 2023","*Apologies for this devolving into a completely unnecessary personal anecdote for like 500 words in the middle… and y’know, for another review that has turned into a whole entire essay.*                                       Thank you to Netgalley for the ARC!                                      This was an enjoyable, informative and important read.                                      For this to exist for gay trans men to see themselves or another self who is nothing like themselves is so brilliant. Harry Nicholas writes about the different stages of his life under different “labels”, he tells of his experiences of fear and hope in exploring the male gay community as a trans man both romantically and sexually, his life building upon and overlapping with queer history, and he does it all in a compelling, generous way.                                      This book drew me in more the further I got into it, I found it all interesting but I think my personal bias toward loving non-fiction that mixes memoir and history etc together made the fact that once he brought in more queer history and his navigation of the modern world with links to the past I was drawn in even more. I loved the theme of water that was brought up repeatedly throughout the book. I think a lot of queer, trans and gender non-conforming people can definitely relate to the struggle and euphoria that can come from that kind of space and I loved seeing his journey through it. In fact all of his descriptions of bravely entering new spaces that scared him were wonderful and relatable to read. I also feel as though I learnt a lot about queer (majority gay male skewed) spaces in London that I didn’t know about and will say, a little selfishly, it did make me sad to think that for queer women there is, as far as I know, not really anything like those much more direct feeling links to their history with spaces like that. I mean, queer women don’t even have modern spaces so it’s unsurprising. As someone who identifies mostly toward the queer/gay woman side (i think - fck binaries y’know) it makes me a little jealous but also so happy that spaces like the bathhouses/saunas, the history of Hampstead Heath and the Royal Vauxhall Tavern as queer spaces do exist and can still be lived in by people today, it’s a beautiful, beautiful thing. (And for someone who did their dissertation on queer space and placemaking, I definitely feel drawn to any kind of exploration of that!)                                      A couple of little moments to do with street harassment really stood out to me personally and I related to the almost slight masochistic sort of positive reaction to it (if you can call it that, and those probably aren’t the right words to describe the feeling) - but this moment of being seen, being seen for what you are even by those who hate you, can hold some power. I remember being in my mid teens, having come out to one person (my clouded memory says it was that same day, it probably wasn’t, but it was very fresh) and walking down the highstreet of my town with that one friend I had told, feeling brave and queer and walking in such a way that I had this thought of, “I wonder if anyone can tell”, and feeling pride and confidence in that. I was high off the fact that I’d come out to one person and it had gone as well as it probably could and maybe it could continue going that way. Then a few minutes later we get shouted at, by a grown man, feet taller than us, from across the square, and I’m saturating in a little bit of that confidence still so I don’t back down and ignore when I should have and I escalate the situation. I remember partially feeling similar to how Harry describes earlier moments of harassment, looking around and thinking “why isn’t anyone doing anything?”, here are two young girls (who still get ID’d at 29 years old so how young did they look at 15) and no one is doing anything. But after that fear, after being worried I’d made some huge mistake by crossing the line into getting physical, and his lit cigarette was being waved about far too close to my face, I did feel a kind of warped pride in being seen, being recognised for the first time by anyone at all for that part of who I was. Which is not to put any levity into that situation, it was horrible and terrifying and we were children and he was an adult and we walked for half an hour as far as we could downtown shaking the whole time. I was terrified to bring it up later that night in the dark of the double bed in her spare room thinking how she must have already felt odd around me before (that shame already ingrained - she must have felt weird sharing a bed with me now right?) and now she must feel scared and disgusted and not want to be around me, why would she when I can put her in danger just for walking down the street. And it hadn’t just been me he’d singled out, he’d put her in that situation too, just by being beside me. But I was wrong, we made light of it that night as much as we could and she’s repeatedly shown me nothing but that since, and she’s still my best friend to this day. Did I learn my lesson from that moment and not engage when people harass me or my friends for being queer or trans, no, not always, and I’ve made decisions I wish I could take back because of it, but I don’t know, it's a line we walk I guess…. I don’t know why I spent like over 500 words telling you that, but it’s a moment I kept thinking about as Harry brought up various similar situations and how he felt differently about them to others he may have been with at the time. It made sense to me and I’m sure it makes sense to a lot of others; I’m sure a huge part of everything he wrote does.                                        “I thought I should be more upset by the shouting than I was. Of course I was bothered by it and I feel sadness when Liam does - I want to make things better and protect him in some way - but I wasn’t so bothered by it myself. If anything, it was also nice to be acknowledged. For a complete stranger to see me as a gay boy and us as a gay couple. It was almost like a confirmation - a rite of passage for a label I’d worked so hard for”.                                       This is a book made for gay trans men, as Nicholas repeatedly notes, he is filling a gap with something he desperately needed, creating representation for others where he couldn’t find it for himself. “To archive our reality.” He speaks of gaps in history, not just for trans men, but for queer people in general, and I suppose in a way, not just our pasts, but images of our futures. As he creates this piece of history for others to look toward to see themselves he takes note of those who aren’t around to be seen in theirs and how that impacts a generation:                                        “For a long time we didn’t have a blueprint of what older relationships could be. This was, in part due to the illegality of homosexuality, gay shame, a requirement to hide in the shadows and the AIDS crisis of the late eighties onwards. Huge numbers of young gay men died way before their time. In their prime, really. We have lost hundreds of thousands of gay men, who, if still around now, would comfortably be in their sixties and seventies. They should be here. For a long time, gay and trans people didn’t have a map or a pathway to follow. We couldn’t see what growing older queer might look like - what our possibilities were. What our weddings might look like (gay marriage was only legalised in the UK in 2014), what possibilities there might be for children or what our lives could look like without children. In a sense we’re still in the infancy of living out our lives.”                                       Nicholas weaves his own life story in with current and past political events and movements. He speaks on the rapidly growing terrifying fascist ideology in the UK and beyond, the “gender critical” movement, those who wish to exclude the T from LGBTQ+, and instances wherein these ‘movements’ have caused real damage, as they continue to do, alongside ways in which they contradict themselves in a darkly laughable way. And yet, Nicholas still manages to paint a picture of a future that has joy in it, that moves toward a future with strength in community and broader horizons for people; in regards to their bodies, their autonomy, their human rights, their relationships, their homes and their families (found, chosen, otherwise.)                                       “Resistance is in joy as well as struggle”                                      and Harry Nicholas displays that beautifully all throughout his work here.                                      (I think the only thing that knocked off a star or maybe even just half a star was that I felt some parts were a little repetitive. Just within small sections, I’d see the same thing said a few times in slightly different ways, and I’d think, 'yes I know, you just said that', but I suppose it works to get the point you’re trying to make across! Very small thing, I’m being too picky I feel… maybe I'll change it, I hate rating things...)                                      I will definitely be recommending this to friends and especially (obviously) recommend for transmasc people and those who are still on their way, figuring out where their place is in the world, in their bodies and sexualities, and in the queer community - as if we ever really stop trying to figure that out.","223 pages, Paperback                             First published May 18, 2023","‘On the bookshelves, there was plenty of stuff on being gay, and much needed, joyous accounts of what it is to be trans, but nothing really that encapsulates what is it to be both – to exist in the hazy terrain between.’                              After his relationship with his girlfriend of 5 years ended, Harry realised he was a single adult for the first time – not only that, but a single, transmasculine and newly out gay man.

To make sense of it all — and himself — he calls on both the cool detachment of the past and the heat of his present physicality, allowing the two to recodify a social system that has long outlived the constraints of finite thinking.                                      First things first: those expecting a salacious read will be disappointed. Harry doesn’t fetishize the trans body, nor does he romanticize the fullness of the cisgender male physique. Above all, he celebrates the interconnectedness — and incongruity— of gender, doing so in a way that frees the reader by extension.                                      Navigating gay spaces, which is arguably the narrative’s main focus, also calls for the traversing of a social system that has not been designed — or modified—to fit an entire segment of the population. It’s a bitter pill to swallow, as is the vitriol spewed by those, who perceive inclusion and acceptance as a threat to their own effortless comfort.                                      And so, as much as we’re awed by the trans body and its unshackled existence, we are also enthralled by its desires and dislocation within a binary system; its many grapples and marvels. Estrangement breeds separation from oneself, and self-acceptance drains one of a certain fixedness.                                      In working towards it, Harry sews his own experiences into the fabric of the collective history of trans people, never suggesting that one man’s story can outweigh such an amalgamation of voices.                                      And so, instead of looking at social nuances through the lens of his own aches, he acts more like a compass, steering the reader toward literature, psychology, social mechanisms, and the words erased by a history of mistrust and ignorance.                                      Thanks to his keen eye, Harry is able to guide us to the junction of the present and the past, literature and activism, sex and love, as well as pride and dread. From there, we explore the subtleties of desirability more so than actual desire. We learn that sexual hunger can, in fact, stem more from an absence of self than its physical cravings.                                      That’s not to say that eroticism doesn’t play a vital role in the life presented to us. But instead of pleasure, we focus more on gratification. And rather than the idolization of another, we examine what it means to be truly wanted and enjoyed, particularly as a trans man. From donning a jockstrap for the first time to pushing a stranger’s sperm out of his body, Harry unpacks himself wholly.

Harry Nicholas starts with the breakup that kickstarted his acceptance of being gay and then looks at his teenage years to see the trajectory of how the labels he used changed. The book focuses then on a lot of gay spaces, as the title suggests, and finding and having sex as a gay trans man, before moving onto his most recent experiences and thinking about longevity and relationships.                                      Nicholas tries to avoid making the memoir solely about trauma, as is one of the trans memoir stereotypes, and there is plenty of moments where even more negative experiences are framed as being important to him and his acceptance of himself. The book comes out of his desire to see books for and about gay trans men when he couldn't find them, but it is also not a guide book and he is careful to highlight that this is his own experiences and only one example of being a gay trans man. Other than Lou Sullivan, there isn't much engagement with other content made by gay trans men, for example online or outside of traditional mainstream publishing, and it might've been good to point towards some of this more at the end, which has a good list of non-fiction and poetry Nicholas found useful. The framing often comes from Nicholas feeling alone as a gay trans man, and by the end it might've been good to return to the fact that this isn't the case.                                      A memoir can be a great way to highlight how experiences can change and show journeys that are less traditional, and this book does that well, particularly around gay spaces and gay sex as a trans man. As it is a memoir, there's a lot of things that are mentioned but not really explored (bisexuality in relation to these spaces and being trans, for example), so there's probably space in the market for more books that use this kind of honesty combined with more analysis or guidance. The title is a clever one and will hopefully draw a lot of people, including cis people, in to read about Nicholas' experiences, and the book combines memoir with some snippets of gay history to show how finding joy in yourself can also mean finding community.","223 pages, Paperback                             First published May 18, 2023","‘On the bookshelves, there was plenty of stuff on being gay, and much needed, joyous accounts of what it is to be trans, but nothing really that encapsulates what is it to be both – to exist in the hazy terrain between.’                              After his relationship with his girlfriend of 5 years ended, Harry realised he was a single adult for the first time – not only that, but a single, transmasculine and newly out gay man.

It touched on serval nuanced topics that I see discussed more and more in trans and queer spaces and the author handled them with care. Every aspect of the author's life that was was discussed was described in a way that really had the impression that they were chosen with care. I think this book would be great for an older teen or young adult audience.                                      That being said, there were a few things I want to find of. For instance, some of the language used for terms such as lesbian and gay was described in a very binary way. In a ""traditional sense"", lesbian and gay identities have been defined by finding the same gender as attractive, whereas now, lesbians are defined as non men who like non men and vice versa. This move to define it that way was in order to include nonbinary people in the labels.                                      That being said, the author talks a lot about transness and the boxes that we have put ourselves into. I was happy to read how inclusive the conversation on gender and gender expression was.                                      The timeline of the book threw me off a bit towards the end. In one of the later chapters, you go from reading about the author's first sexual experience to the next chapter being about the author coming out to his parents. The change in the author's age was a bit hard to keep track of during his life events because of this.                                      The author also did a wonderful job recounting his life experiences and connecting it to queer history. We as queer people have to actively work to educate ourselves on our history because it is not taught in any type of curriculum (at least not in the US). The ability to tie the author's experience to events and people who worked incredibly hard to get us to where we are now is one of my favorite parts of the book.                                      The ending was very sweet and left me with a deep feeling of hopefulness which I think is very important for a book like this. Yes, queer people face a lot of adversity but there is also a great deal of community and freedom.","223 pages, Paperback                             First published May 18, 2023","‘On the bookshelves, there was plenty of stuff on being gay, and much needed, joyous accounts of what it is to be trans, but nothing really that encapsulates what is it to be both – to exist in the hazy terrain between.’                              After his relationship with his girlfriend of 5 years ended, Harry realised he was a single adult for the first time – not only that, but a single, transmasculine and newly out gay man.

It needed to be seen and read and needed to be archived’                                      Yes, yes it did.                                      This is a moving account of Harry’s own experience as a newly out gay man. What makes Harry’s story so “unique” (I say unique but 77% of trans people report their sexual orientation as anything but heterosexual) is that he is a trans man who was previously in a straight-passing relationship. In his account, Harry navigates the gay scene, whilst dismantling notions of masculinity and femininity that adhere to the binary conception. We bare witness to Harry’s moments of joy, as well as his moments of melancholy, all in which has crafted such an inspiring, thoughtful account (and man).                                      Harry confronts the invasive questions that many have (and have the audacity to ask), offering an honest account of the relationship between sexuality and gender, and the confusion that emerged inwardly, but also to those around him. Harry details the transition within a societal frame, acknowledging how being seen as a man granted him treatment he wasn’t permitted to as a woman (there’s a bit that he talks about walking and who will get out of whose way first - big shock, it’s women who move), whilst also detailing the abuse he’s been subjected to for being a gay man.                                      This is an incredibly touching account that made me weep tears of joy and tears of sadness - overall, any kinda tears.

It is intentional. It is magic.""                                      This book offers a raw, heartful insight into the struggles and triumphs that come with being both trans and gay in the modern world. This book brings the readers along through the author's journey from trying ""really, really, really hard to be a gay girl"" to finally stepping into a committed relationship as a gay trans man.                                      I think the approach the author takes towards discussing trans-ness is incredibly important for both cisgender and transgender people to read. For decades, trying to ""pass"" as best as you could has been hailed as the end goal for trans people. In the eyes of society, trans people could not truly succeed until they were no longer perceived as transgender, or in other words until they fully reintegrated themselves back into a cishet society. But this book presents a different narrative of being trans. It acknowledges that a trans body will never be the same as a cisgender body, and this should be celebrated rather than ignored. Just because a man has a vagina doesn't make him less of a man, and his choice to not get rid of it doesn't make him any less trans.                                      Not only does this book talk about self-love, but it also talks about finding real love in a hostile world. I think sometimes we can fall into the trap of believing that we must find love externally first before we can love ourselves, treating external validation as ""proof"" that we are really worth it. But in this book, we learn alongside Harry how self-love is the foundation for allowing other people to really love you as who you are. The fact that Harry writes this book from the perspective of someone who has found a caring partner who loves him not in spite of, but because of his trans identity shows the reader that they are worthy of love and self-respect.                                      Though I really appreciated how open and honest the book was, some sections made me a bit uncomfortable as a lesbian. I found myself cringing internally as I read about men having sex, and some of the details were more graphic than I was anticipating going into reading this book. But, I recognize that I am not the target audience for these sections, and I think the discomfort is something to confront rather than something to run away from. Cishet sexuality is very prevalent in the media, so hearing a trans man's experiences with the world of gay sex is an important perspective for everyone to read, not just trans men.                                      Overall I very much enjoyed reading this book, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the queer and trans experience. I would like to thank NetGalley and Jessica Kingsley Publishers for giving me the opportunity to read an eARC of this book.","223 pages, Paperback                             First published May 18, 2023","‘On the bookshelves, there was plenty of stuff on being gay, and much needed, joyous accounts of what it is to be trans, but nothing really that encapsulates what is it to be both – to exist in the hazy terrain between.’                              After his relationship with his girlfriend of 5 years ended, Harry realised he was a single adult for the first time – not only that, but a single, transmasculine and newly out gay man.

Pulling only from his own experience, he also references a lot of queer media, influential figures, and historical events (most notably those in London), and how they relate to his experience growing into himself and adulthood.                                      This was an extremely compelling look into the nuances of being trans and gay, how those two identities merge and at times clash for Nicholas. He doesn't hold back in his honest portrayal of growing up with dysphoria, yet eventually celebrating his femininity as a gay man; his first time having sex with another man, and his sex life in general; his relationships, addiction to dating apps, and the impacts these things had on his mental health; and so much more. He challenges stereotypes at times and finds validation in them in others, and then unpacks that validation: why he feels he needs it but also acknowledges that it's not healthy. He dispels rumors like trans men being unable to conceive after years on testosterone, and how the healthcare system overall doesn't know how to handle trans people (nor does it really try to).                                      Being able to relate to his experiences as a gay man but also having my eyes opened to so many things I've never even thought about regarding the trans experience made for a very powerful read. I loved that Nicholas includes many resources and names of places in his hometown that he's found safety and joy in. If these conversations interest you - and even if they don't, honestly - pick this one up.                                      (Side note, for some reason the formatting on my e-book copy was kind of weird, it didn't affect my reading experience but I'm assuming it'll be fixed at release. Or a likely possibility that it was just because of the ARC file I received on my Kindle - worth noting I guess).

This book was fine! First, bear with my general ""uh oh should have read the blurb"" info. When i looked at this cover before requesting an ARC of it, it looked historical? Like it was about gay trans men from maybe the 80s? The aesthetic just feels specifically archival. But, it is actually a contemporary book. And for me, therein lies the issue.                                      I just... know a lot of gay and queer trans men right now, and over the last like 25 years. I have talked a LOT to MANY of them about being on apps, being in gay men's spaces that assume cis-ness, about that mid/post transition shift to being into dudes that many people didn't feel in the same way before. So while this may be new or novel content to a lot of people, i felt sort of like, oh, a conventionally attractive 26 year old wants to tell me about dating as if he is the first person who has ever done it? I'm good.                                      That said! The writing is pretty good, there are some good points made, and for a lot of people this is probably a really valuable perspective. I just read Lou Sullivan's diaries a few months ago and was hoping for something more along those lines generationally. But, i gave it 3.5 stars because i think someone will be really glad to have this.

It was the biggest act of self-care and self-love I have ever been able to give myself.“                                      A Trans Man Walks Into A Gay Bar is a cracker of a book that is touching, honest and funny; the conversational and often lighthearted tone really makes the authors voice stand out. There are experiences of transphobia and homophobia discussed but this is not a book centred on trauma but one that talks and focuses more on the joy of knowing yourself and finding your community.                                      I’ve read many stories of gay experiences and many of trans experiences but have seen and read very few books with representation of both and the intersection of identities was both powerful and compelling. The narrative of the authors journey as he grew and saw himself was not just a journey of finding himself but also one of finding a space in a community when it doesn’t always feel that there is an obvious space for you.                                      Harry is clear at the start and throughout the book that this is his experience as a gay trans man and that there are many other voices and experiences that need to be heard and sought out; he even includes a reading list at the end.                                      This was an engrossing read that made me not just want to go for a drink with Harry but also reminded me how diverse the experiences of my beautiful LGBTQIA+ community are; I learnt so much from this book and am also inspired to keep seeking out stories from lesser heard voices in the community.                                      “I thought maybe I should just try to get on with things, live quietly with my head bowed and behave. Perhaps there would be some queer resistance just in the act of living. But no. If ever there was a time to speak out about the terrain between being gay and trans, it is now.”","223 pages, Paperback                             First published May 18, 2023","‘On the bookshelves, there was plenty of stuff on being gay, and much needed, joyous accounts of what it is to be trans, but nothing really that encapsulates what is it to be both – to exist in the hazy terrain between.’                              After his relationship with his girlfriend of 5 years ended, Harry realised he was a single adult for the first time – not only that, but a single, transmasculine and newly out gay man.

In this memoir she focuses her writing skills on her journey to becoming a mother, and her role as a daughter and the result is nothing short of fabulous. She writes about her and her husband's experience with trying to conceive a child and the difficulties they faced. In alternating chapters she writes about her father and the horrific car wreck that changed his life forever. But not only did the wreck impact his life but those in his orbit, especially his daughter Cassandra.                                      Readers will want to skip ahead to find out if she was able to become pregnant. Don't do it, enjoy the ride.

There is a secret that young Cassandra Jackson doesn’t know, and it’s evident in the way her father cries her name out in his sleep. Through awkward encounters with family, she comes to realize that she is named after her father's niece, and looks eerily like the child’s mother, both of whom were killed in a car wreck along with her father's beloved mother, and—as she soon discovers—his first wife. Cassandra learns to keep silent about the wreck, but soon learns there is no way to outpace the claw-like grip of her family’s past trauma.                              In this luminous memoir, Jackson attempts to unearth her lost family, while also creating a new one--only to discover little progress separates the past from the present. As she moves back and forth between her girlhood and her journey to motherhood, Jackson reveals the chilling parallels between the harrowing inhumanity of Jim Crow medical care and the toxic discrimination that undergirds healthcare in the United States today. But as she traces the cascading effects of loss punctuated by racism, she also discovers a powerful legacy of fearless love and furious perseverance that she hopes to extend to a new generation.

But as she traces the cascading effects of loss punctuated by racism, she also discovers a powerful legacy of fearless love and furious perseverance that she hopes to extend to a new generation.                              Lyrical, urgent, and wise, this is an unforgettable story of reclaiming the past to reclaim ourselves."

Suffice it to say, this is one you need to check out!                                      Miss Major Speaks takes us through candid conversations with a legendary queer elder and activist. She introduces us to some key people and events that impacted her life and politics, while showing us how conditions for trans women of color have (and haven't) changed.                                      There is so much happening in this small book but a few key things: She heavily critiques the focus on representation (tokenizing and assimilation) that have remained an issue throughout her time and has relegated the most marginalized to the back. The majority of her conversations also go back to issues with the prison and policing. Of course these two points begin together in her discussion of the Stonewall riots and the way that the story of what followed is (mis)remembered today - but that is just where the conversation begins.                                      It was really incredible to see so many parts of queer history that I've read about before come together through one person's life. So many things can feel like they happened so long ago until you hear someone who is still around talk about it. The choice to make most of this just conversations rather than one narrative throughout adds to this, as it feels like you're right there listening. The introduction does have more of a linear structure that frames the conversation and gives necessary background, but the discussion is really where the history comes to life.                                      This isn't a 101 text or an explainer - this is the raw, honest conversation of someone who has lived life and has payed attention to these parts of history that have gone on and how they connect. So go into this book to learn but if you are less educated on trans issues or the prison industrial complex, I would not be inclined to tell you to read this as a primary introduction - but it should be on your list. This sort of wisdom from someone who has lived through all of this is invaluable.

Her main messages are, ""we need to take care of each other, cuz the Powers that Be will not look out for us"" and ""nobody is disposable."" Even if you already know these things, read ""Miss Major Speaks"" anyways because 1) the interview format (with her longtime friend) is SUPER engaging, 2) as so many of us are fighting for our lives, we need to remember -from someone who has been around the block - that we can get through this, and that organizing with your communities can be a joyful thing to do, and 3) you'll learn some things! I learned that Miss Major started to really think about organizing when she was in solitary confinement, housed next to Big Black, a leader of the Attica Prison Uprising. And I learned how Miss Major organized trans women to work as home health aids to gay men who were dying from AIDS, when the gurls (as Miss Major calls them) needed jobs, and nobody else would provide this care work. ""Miss Major Speaks"" is for anyone at any point in their organizing journeys.","176 pages, Paperback                             First published May 16, 2023","The future of Black, queer, and trans liberation explored by a legendary transgender elder and activist                              Miss Major Griffin-Gracy is a veteran of the infamous Stonewall Riots, a former sex worker, and a transgender elder and activist who has survived Bellevue psychiatric hospital, Attica Prison, the HIV/AIDS crisis and a world that white supremacy has built.

Miss Major, along with Toshio Meronek, provides an essential narrative that exposes the persistent systemic barriers, discrimination, violence, oppression, and marginalisation that continue to disproportionately affect trans people and communities, but through this also highlights the incredibly strength, resilience, and heart and soul of the trans community on the path toward liberation.                                      Miss Major’s statement that, “It's as if Stonewall never happened because it didn't change anything for us” resonates w me deeply, especially in the wake of 2021 being the deadliest year on record fr trans people. This book masterfully highlights the profound truth that achieving rights and liberation fr some does not automatically extend to all routinely marginalised people and communities. So by centring the voices and experiences of multiply marginalised queer people and communities, this book serves as a rallying cry fr genuine and true progress, where no one is left behind. Miss Major’s invaluable insights shed light on the inadequacies of surface-level liberation (like the inclusion of trans people in the military), which rarely actually lead to true liberation fr all. Rather, it’s through things like collective action, community care, mutual aid, etc etc, we have the power to make significant strides towards a society that embraces safety and liberation fr all of us, and especially those who most need and deserve it. “If we don't save all of us, none of us are saved,” as Miss Major says.                                      ‘Miss Major Speaks’ is a vital contribution to the literature on trans histories and activism, reminding us of the urgent need to amplify the stories and demands of those historically left behind. It is an unflinching and inspiring testament to the resilience, strength, and unwavering spirit of Miss Major, a true Black trans revolutionary, and more broadly the trans community as a whole. This book deserves every bit of its five-star rating! Please give it a read!","176 pages, Paperback                             First published May 16, 2023","The future of Black, queer, and trans liberation explored by a legendary transgender elder and activist                              Miss Major Griffin-Gracy is a veteran of the infamous Stonewall Riots, a former sex worker, and a transgender elder and activist who has survived Bellevue psychiatric hospital, Attica Prison, the HIV/AIDS crisis and a world that white supremacy has built.

The book starts with a short bio of her written by Meronek, and then continues through 10 thematic interview sessions between Meronek and Miss Major, talking about her life and activism, as well as her lessons for others.                                      From her time in the Stonewall Riots, as a sex worker and HIV/AIDS care worker, in prison, and through decades of leadership and activism for trans women and sex workers, Miss Major has a wealth of experience and insight. Throughout her life, she's provided refuge and community to trans gurls, operated a needle exchange van in SF, and stood by the sides of men dying of AIDS. She's advocated for trans women and sex workers ceaselessly and with a level of positivity that's even more impressive because of the obstacles she's faced.                                      This is a book everyone should read; and especially feels like an important during the month of Pride, as a reminder not to homogenize the queer community and its experiences. Miss Major provides countless reminders of the ways in which trans gurls are still in danger, while other, sometimes more superficial change happens. She emphasizes acting as a force against The Powers That Be, and provides an important reminder to be cautious of people just paying lip service or tokenizing trans women. Again, her positive attitude and sense of humor remain firm, even as she doesn't hesitate to call out injustice where she sees it.                                      I learned a lot from reading this -- I'm so glad this preserves and shares Miss Major's story for others to read and learn from!                                      ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️                                      Genre: memoir / interview                                      Pub Date: May 16, 2023                                      Thanks to Verso for sending me a copy of this book!","176 pages, Paperback                             First published May 16, 2023","The future of Black, queer, and trans liberation explored by a legendary transgender elder and activist                              Miss Major Griffin-Gracy is a veteran of the infamous Stonewall Riots, a former sex worker, and a transgender elder and activist who has survived Bellevue psychiatric hospital, Attica Prison, the HIV/AIDS crisis and a world that white supremacy has built.

We hang out, eat tacos and generally crack each other up with all types of bad jokes. If you’ve ever seen him speak either live and in person or on the internet you already know what a dynamic orator he is, just an outstanding storyteller. His skill with words translates well to the page. This book left me first devastated by the various tragedies that his family has suffered and then inspired by how he is dealing with it.                                      Leon is all about family. His mother radiates love from her welcoming eyes, his father is hilarious, and his son LJ is simply amazing. A beautiful and deeply human family, without even mentioning his sister, brothers, aunts, uncles, grandfather and grandmother. There certainly are a lot of them and I’m not even sure how many of them are really related, but that’s probably the point; they bring you in and make you part of the family.                                      That’s sort of what Leon does with this book. He’s been closely watching his family, his community, his city since he was a very small boy, figuring how everything works, how all the pieces go together. He shares these stories in a way that allows you to sort out how and why everything happened the way it did, he welcomes you to the family. Then he lays out the details of his journey so far and offers the outline of how we all, people with divergent perspectives from various groups, can move forward together. We have to sit down and talk, resist judging each other, find common ground and build the sort of world our children deserve. That might sound overly simplistic, but coming from a man who was able to meet and talk openly with the police officer that shot him, it is an incredible challenge to join the family. I hope we can live up to it.","320 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","A “powerful and insightful” (Cyntoia Brown-Long, author of Free Cyntoia ) memoir in the vein of Just Mercy and The Sum of Us that upends our understanding about the future of policing in the United States and explores how we can begin healing from systemic injustice.

Leon Ford's life and circumstances are very different from my own and yet, as he concludes, we, as people, have certain things in common. The book is written as if the author were speaking. For me, that sometimes made it hard to follow; the timeline shifts and there are so many people mentioned. (I think that the written word should be more formal.) It might be more difficult for someone not from Pittsburgh to understand the many references to places. Yet, this was a book that I stayed up late reading and I am still thinking about Leon and his goals. I truly hope that he succeeds in making a better world for his son and everyone else.                                      ""I realized that I lived in two worlds.

(91)                                      An interesting part of the story is that Leon spent time in Europe, thinking about moving overseas. He started in Split, Croatia.                                      ""Black people were noticeably absent from the city. Little did that matter to me. Being there, the weight of America was lifted. . .Wealth had given me the opportunity to travel, just as wealth has cushioned me somewhat from everyday racism."" (229)                                      ""To my way of thinking, when we have conversations as individuals, our differences don't matter.""

In 2012, nineteen-year-old Leon Ford was shot five times by a Pittsburgh police officer during a racially charged traffic stop stemming from a case of mistaken identity. When he woke up in the hospital, he was faced with two life-changing he was a new father, and he was paralyzed from the waist down. Leon found the only way to move forward was to let go of his bitterness and learn to practice forgiveness.                              Now, in this memoir and manifesto, Leon illustrates how this harrowing experience has inspired a deep reckoning with the issues his community is facing, not only with police brutality, but also an epidemic of street violence, toxic masculinity and its impact on Black fatherhood, and the lack of disability rights and mental health access in disenfranchised communities. In the wake of countless similar shootings across the country, Leon details how he turned towards social activism, dedicating himself to bridging the gap between the police and the communities they are supposed to serve.                              With a voice filled with “healing, triumph, and resilience” (Shaka Senghor, bestselling author of Writing My Wrongs ), Ford offers fresh, counterintuitive ways we can effect social change. Leon shows us how, together, we can move away from retribution and towards transformative justice in order to end police brutality and heal as a country. As he once said, “Lead with love. Start compassionate conversations even with individuals and systems that have caused you pain. I know from experience that you can make your pain purposeful.”"

This is not a sanitized memoir; he’s not shying away or artfully retelling the more painful moments of his experience. Leon writes about his rage, about his community, and about his many moments of doubt. And that’s what makes his confidence & hope so much more powerful.                                      If you’ve spent even one moment in Leon’s presence, you can tell he’s a leader. He knows his power, and grounds himself and his messaging in compassion and love.                                      Leon’s dedication to serving his community - and his openness about his healing journey in order to get to a safe place in order to pursue this work - is deeply inspiring. I especially appreciated his acknowledgement of activism burnout, and how social justice leaders will speak up for everyone but themselves. It was lovely to read about Leon’s pledge to care for himself first & his desire to remain an active and involved father.                                      He has an incredibly fresh voice and set of ideas around social change. While most folks are not powerful connectors or leaders like Leon - let alone at a point in their healing journey where they can enter very vulnerable spaces - his thoughts are valuable, helpful, and hopeful for any reader.

However, the experience I am about to recount is unlike any I have ever encountered. To be frank, every character within the pages of this book struck me as utterly unlikable. The new batch of students in middle school, in particular, took it upon themselves to bully poor Rex mercilessly. Rather than coping with the torment in a healthy manner, Rex transferred his frustration onto his innocent younger sibling, leaving me disheartened. And then, to compound matters, Rex's mother reacted in a manner that could only be described as many unbridled outbursts. Curiously, no one seemed compelled to intervene and resolve this chaotic predicament. It was as if the narrative unfolded in a sequence of uncomfortable and disconcerting events, one after another. Undoubtedly, there will be young readers who will find solace in these pages, connecting with the story on a personal level. Alas, as I read, my aged heart struggled to find resonance within this tale.","224 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","A humorous and heartwarming middle-grade graphic memoir about fitting in, facing bullies, and finding the right pair of glasses.

He lives with his hardworking mother, younger brother Ford, and Ford's father, Sam. Rex's father has a new family, and while he is well to do, does not support Rex monetarily as well as he should. Middle school is tough, especially when his long time best friend Drew decides to hang out with the ""cool kids"" that bully Rex and make fun of the fact that he gets free lunch and his mother works at a local Chinese restaurant. Rex struggles in school because he can't see the board, and he gets headaches from trying to focus. He eventually gets examined for glasses, but ends up with a pair he thinks are ugly because they are less expensive. The lenses are thicker than he expects, and Oliver makes fun of that as well. There are other tensions in Rex's world, including the fact that his mother fights with his abuela, who is one of the few people who seem to understand Rex, and who offers rare treats like new clothes and different food, which angers Rex's mother further. Hiding during lunch one day, Rex meets Scott, who used to wear glasses and likes comics. Rex had spoken up when Oliver was picking on Scott, and the two become friends, bonding over their shared interests. Middle school is still a struggle for Rex, but he gains a little perspective when his abuela shares things about her impoverished upbringing that are even worse, and he talks to his mom about her reasons for resenting her mother. After suffering with broken glasses for a while, Rex gets new ones that he likes better. His father pays for them after his mother complains, and thanks to contributions from both his abuela and father, Rex is able to go on a Washington, D.C. trip with his classmates and feels somewhat better about his whole experience.                                      Strengths: The style of artwork is appealing, and conducive to showing all of the angst that Rex is feeling. His mother and stepfather seem a bit nicer in this book than in Free Lunch, so the story centers more on Rex's struggles in school and with his glasses. It's good that he makes a friend not only in Drew but with a couple of other students who like Star Wars and comics; it was very realistic that his elementary school classmates could have gone to a different middle school, leaving him with few friends. Rex does make efforts at standing up for himself and for others, which was good to see. Graphic memoirs see a lot of circulation, but fewer of them have boys as the main characters.                                      Weaknesses: I got glasses in 7th grade, almost fifty years ago, and not a single person made fun of me. I was also very short, and wore a back brace for scoliosis, so I was much geekier and much more of a target than Rex! I've talked to students at my school as well, and so many people have glasses and braces that this is no longer a subject of derision. I'm sorry that Ogle was bothered by bullies when he was growing up, but I'm not sure how this will resonate with my young readers.                                      What I really think: This is a good choice for readers who like graphic novels about children who struggle with various issues, like Telgemeier's Guts or Libenson's Invisible Emmie.","224 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","A humorous and heartwarming middle-grade graphic memoir about fitting in, facing bullies, and finding the right pair of glasses.

I also was a geeky middle schooler in the 1990s who got glasses and hated them so, so much. I also got hit in the face with a (basket)ball, but mine was intentional and my glasses didn't break. Has anyone told you before that middle school is the WORST?  The kids are awful, the teachers are burnt out, home life sucks because you're grown, *but not enough*, and your parents just don't understand (remember, 90s kid). Four Eyes captures this experience perfectly.                                      I absolutely love the fact that a character with a stutter is included, and the only mention of it at all is when they talk about how sports helped them make friends. They're never treated any differently and that's beautiful.                                      Spoiler                                      My reason for knocking off .25 star is because even though Rex was going through a lot, he was still a little $@*+head to his mom and while she could have been more supportive in some scenes, she really was doing her best for her spoiled American teenager. She did not deserve all his selfish crap, and then she took her distress out on her generous mom!  I tried the same actions with my mom and she did not take it as chill as Rex's mom. I still have trauma! I honestly don't know if my peers had my experience, or Rex's.

He is looking forward to hanging out with his best friend, having a locker, and switching classes. When he realizes that most of the kids he knew in elementary school are going to a different school because of redistricting, he still has hopes when he sees his BFF, but in a matter of days, he becomes the target of bullying and is ditched by his friend.                                      The next bad news comes when he suddenly has trouble seeing the notes on the board. He's never had that problem before. His grades begin to suffer. He finally admits that he can't see which prompts a trip to the eye doctor. Since his mother doesn't have insurance, Rex is fitted with the least attractive pair of glasses, and even they cost over $200.                                      Now he has earned the nickname Four Eyes and even more jokes are flung his way. At least he has finally found a new friend. They eat lunch together and share comics. It's not all smooth sailing, but between his mom's efforts to make things better and his grandmother's kindness, he begins to settle in as he tries to just be himself.

His friend Drew is there, though, but he's obsessed with becoming one of the cool kids and their leader is a bully who isn't nice to anyone. It gets worse when Rex discovers that he can't see what teachers are writing on the board, and has to get glasses. His family can't afford a lot of things and Rex has to get the cheapest glasses - ugly frames and thick bottle-like lenses that make his eyes look huge. Other kids at school tease him constantly (is this still a thing?) and Rex can't decide whether it's worse to be teased or to fail all of his classes and suffer terrible headaches from eye strain and not being able to see. He does eventually make some new friends, though it happens slowly - ones who don't care about his glasses and like him for who he is. There are a lot of emotional scenes in this book with Rex and his family, while they struggle to balance finances and relationships.

I did a little research on Google and found a Huff Post article by Ogle that provided me with context. He had some very challenging moments during his upbringing and it just reminded me that we all have varying pathways. It made me think of the scene with Rex and his abuela talking in the restaurant.

For Ogle, it was his getting glasses, specifically the bullying associated with it.                                      It was about friendships won and lost over middle school, his connection with his grandmother, and paying for the glasses that was the focus, not on the elements that already-readers of Ogle know a little more about. Either way, it works so well.","224 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","A humorous and heartwarming middle-grade graphic memoir about fitting in, facing bullies, and finding the right pair of glasses.

Drew convinces Victor and the others to let Rex sit at their table, but Rex doesn’t fit in. For one thing, everyone else brings their own lunch while Rex has to buy school lunch. The others constantly deride him for that. Then, Rex has to get glasses, which are super thick and he becomes the target of more bullying until finally Victor dismisses from their table.

For Rex, he feels different because he now has to wear glasses, his family is poor and he's on the free lunch program, he's short and his best friend has joined a popular clique that regularly mocks other kids for fun. I appreciated that by the end Rex has gained some perspective both on his challenges, as well as other kids. His conversation with his Abuela particularly gives him new appreciation for what he does have and he ends up being kinder to his family and friends. Ogle captures the somewhat universal extreme emotions and drama of middle school, while also tackling his family's particular challenges like poverty, his father's anger and absenteeism etc.                                      Thank you to Scholastic for the ARC received at ALA LibLearnX.

I sat down and devoured this graphic novel in one sitting. It is my first Rex Ogle book, though I’ve heard of his other titles. As a kid who had to get bifocals in 3rd grade as her first pair of glasses and had (and continues to have) strong feelings about having to wearing them. I was bullied in middle school about them, being forced in New England cold winters to have my glasses on against my belly and quickly put them on right before getting on a full bus of kids (or else they’d steam up), and having the popular kids refuse me a seat and being forced to crouch in the aisle for the 10 minutes to school. As I said, I have feelings about wearing glasses. Ironic when my mom worked for an optometrist.

This was an absolutely amazing graphic novel. Super easy to read. Totally relatable (whether you wear glasses or not) and with an ending that will make you tear up a bit. On a personal note, I had to start wearing glasses when I was seven years old and the kids were brutal. Probably because I picked out this huge pair of bright red specks...but, still!!

It helped that I knew the characters and already cared about them, which kept me turning the pages.

Rex’s mom comes off as a little stressed by work, but otherwise encouraging and caring about his struggles. He even tries out calling Sam “Pop”?! I’m curious what the motivation for that choice was, when it doesn’t seem like there were any feelings like that in the other two memoirs.

Ree is vulnerable and raw as she tells of her loves and losses as she transforms into the truest version of herself after losing herself in her marriage and work (and youth). Her voice has an authenticity and sincerity to it that made this all the more powerful. From her mother’s mental illness, to a dear friendship ending, to her ex-husband’s financial control, to her romantic encounters, she puts it all on the page with grace. She delightfully weaves food, specific dishes such as her nan’s jam drops and her mama’s spinach pie, into her telling of becoming which I of course particularly loved. The actual book will contain the recipes and I’m eager to recreate them to taste the food Ree has set into this narrative.","336 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","Reminiscent of Michelle Zauner's                               Crying in H Mart                              and Dolly Alderton's                               Everything I Know About Love                              , Charlotte Ree's                               Heartbake                              is part memoir, part recipe book, and part joyous battle cry for those who find themselves lonely at any age, hungry for so much more from life.

2023-07-03,Heartbake: a bittersweet memoir,,Charlotte Ree,4.37,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir']",Buy on Amazon,Bree T,Rating 4 out of 5,"June 6, 2023","I’ve followed Charlotte Ree on instagram for a long time – she works in publishing and also posts a lot of desserts, probably the content I was looking for. I have been aware of this one for a while, as she’s spoken about the process of it on social media and so I knew I wanted to read it because I really love memoirs that are also about food.                                      Just 24 hours before Sydney entered its first lockdown in 2020, Charlotte Ree left her husband when they’d been married a very short time. This is the story of her processing that separation, her foray back into the dating world and all its ups and downs and throughout all of that, the role that food played in her emotional recovery. At times, in the dark days after just separating, Ree couldn’t muster the effort to cook much and so she ate boiled eggs – perfectly hard boiled eggs, which is why there’s one on the cover here. From there, as she felt like she could do more, she moved to soft boiled eggs with toast soldiers and then, more complex foods. But originally, those boiled eggs she says, nourished her when she wasn’t able to nourish herself.                                      I love food but I have a complex relationship with it. I have multiple health issues which means my digestive system is temperamental and unpredictable, severely limiting what I can safely eat at times. I don’t enjoy cooking myself but I love watching cooking and having other people cook for me. My husband’s love language is feeding people, much like I feel Charlotte Ree’s might be and this book has vivid descriptions of the meals she has cooked for people. There are also multiple recipes included at the end of the book as well, for some of the meals that get a mention more than once (such as her perfect hard-boiled egg, her Pa’s pesto, and a few other favourites).                                      This is a no holds barred memoir – the author is definitely not afraid to explore everything at the deepest level. It’s a frank look at the relationship that led to her marriage, how she came to the decision to leave that marriage and everything that came after that as well. It is at times, not a particularly easy book to read as the author navigates the struggle of having had her marriage not work out and dealing with the grief of that loss and also the complexity of dipping a toe back into the dating pool. I quite often say that I could never deal with dating apps, if I were to ever end up single again. I’m deeply introverted and anxious about meeting new people and the idea of it just….I can’t. I’d live alone with like, cats or something. So I admire people who navigate this world, putting themselves out there, often for scenarios that are misleading or disappointing. Because sometimes you can find something special. When dating, Ree often has her dates over to her apartment so she can cook for them, it seems to be her preferred sort of date. But she also details the meals she eats out and on the occasions someone else cooks for her, she describes that too. I love the way she writes about food, the reverence that pours from the words, how important it is to her. This book also details an experience she has with the uglier side of dating, something that was quite harrowing and probably a significant and realistic fear of a lot of women who step into this world. It can put you in a vulnerable place and the result of this if you encounter the wrong person, someone who will take advantage of that, is detailed here.                                      The parts of this book that I enjoyed the most were of course the parts detailing food but also about family. The various family members that had shaped her life and the meals and foods she associated with them. I think everyone has foods that are comfort foods or ones that have been prepared for them by a certain person more than anyone else, foods that we associate with certain people. For me, I know so many of my core family memories and connections were formed around food: my Nan’s homemade cupcakes and lamingtons and her pork roast with everything, my husband’s bolognese sauce, my mother-in-law’s chicken schnitzel. They are foods I associate with those people and always will. This book really made me think about that, the sorts of foods that I would group together, the foods that have defined parts of my life. So many descriptions and comments in this book encouraged me to think about similar things I’d experienced or similar connections I’d made. My taste in food is definitely a lot plainer but I think probably so many people could be inspired by some of these vivid descriptions about what food can mean, as well as how it tastes.                                      This is raw, very vulnerable, filled with beautiful moments but also a lot of heartbreak, self reflection, picking yourself up and starting again (and again). It was a really deep and meaningful memoir, something I enjoyed reading. And I love the idea of the recipes at the back. I’m going to start with the boiled egg.                                      ***A copy of this book was provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review***","336 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","Reminiscent of Michelle Zauner's                               Crying in H Mart                              and Dolly Alderton's                               Everything I Know About Love                              , Charlotte Ree's                               Heartbake                              is part memoir, part recipe book, and part joyous battle cry for those who find themselves lonely at any age, hungry for so much more from life.

I got along to one of her sessions after seeing so many people I trust, hyping this book since its release a few weeks ago: and I’ve gotta say … I *get it* now.

I think the design of this book is so clever too (even though I’d previously been working on the assumption that it was a straight-up cookbook) I understand now why it has this … weight and texture to it. You literally want to hug it to your chest, especially after reading those first few pages. Phew!                                      I’m gonna say this book has the heartbreak and hilarity of Nora Ephron, wrapped up in a Nancy Meyers aesthetic kitchen.

The book is much smaller than I expected - it is cute and beautifully bound though and shorter than I thought it would be. Also mainly memoir rather than cookbook - I thought it would be like Molly Weizenberg’s A home made Life which is the benchmark by which I judge memoirs with recipes and it isn’t quite. Her memoir is a bit about her childhood especially her mother and her mental illness and a lot about her first marriage which broke up before the first Covid lockdown in Sydney. There’s a brutally honest section about her dating adventures after her divorce which made me wince a bit - not just that I may be more prudish than she is but because it felt unresolved like I wasn’t sure what the point of the recounting was apart from to share the gory details? Another reviewer said it felt unfinished and I think that is it - a memoir maybe should be written much further down the road when you have the benefit of hindsight and greater wisdom - not 2-3 years after it has happened. Otherwise it seems just like a voyeuristic perve into someone’s sexual (mis) adventures. Part of why I feel this way is her lack of understanding or perception as to why her relationships failed, especially the last one where the Ginger seemed to know from the start that it was not going to last, a fact borne out by the last chapter, but she didn’t see it coming at all. The recipes are very simple ones - food she ate and shared and I will probably try making some of them.","336 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","Reminiscent of Michelle Zauner's                               Crying in H Mart                              and Dolly Alderton's                               Everything I Know About Love                              , Charlotte Ree's                               Heartbake                              is part memoir, part recipe book, and part joyous battle cry for those who find themselves lonely at any age, hungry for so much more from life.

In which case I essentially had.                                      Life is messy, it is complicated, it is full of pathways that rise and fall, divert and send us in directions that we perhaps never imagined.

The way her words open up throughout the book made me feel as if she was sitting there, right next to me. My eyes welled up with both tears of sorrow and of happiness as I savored every last word. By the time I had finished reading the book in its entirety, the clock read 1:15am and I had a hankering for a boiled egg and butter laden toast soldiers.

2023-07-03,Heartbake: a bittersweet memoir,,Charlotte Ree,4.37,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir']",Buy on Amazon,Ian,Rating 4 out of 5,"June 20, 2023","Having purchased Charlotte's first cook book, 'Just Desserts' (it's marvellous BTW) I had assumed 'Heartbake' was her second cookbook. On arriving the day of release, I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderfully striking yellow hardback only to discover, in fact it was mostly a memoir. I was curious as I've followed Charlotte a little over the years as she's employed in the 'book biz' and she's worked with authors I admire.                                      There are many good elements to this memoir:                                      - Charlotte has a good written voice which I believe authentically reflects Charlotte, the person. It reads really well as the pages turned easily as Charlotte is so engaging in how she communicates. She's always been an avid reader and as a publicist she knows how to tell a story with an honest and engaging manner.                                      - Charlotte has a big heart. She loves intensely and she's discovering the importance of loving oneself as intensely as others which is so important for all of us.                                      - there's a rawness and vulnerability to Charlotte's story. This helps the reader develop an empathy for Charlotte and we become cheerleaders for her as she discovers herself, her needs, wants and how to both receive and give love.                                      - Charlotte loves food both the simple and sophisticated. I do too. I loved how she enjoyed the simplicity of a boiled egg during lockdown but also has experienced some wonderful gastronomic adventures both domestically and globally.                                      - we catch a glimpse of how tough the pandemic-induced lockdowns were for people living by themselves. And one, like Charlotte, who was grappling with her marriage ending and the intense emotions such trauma produces. It reinforced in my mind that if something like another pandemic lands we must work on an alternative solution to lockdowns.                                      - even though there's a section of the book where there's a roll call of Charlotte's dating app (mis)adventures which I questioned we needed to witness, it added substance to the authentic discovery and healing process Charlotte went on.                                      - oh, and there are a bunch of Charlotte's favourite recipes at the back. My only comment is that the hardback nature of the book isn't really conducive to lying flat on the kitchen bench when attempting to make the recipe.                                      The book ends with a sense of it's just the beginning. I feel this reflects the fact that Charlotte has so much life ahead of her, so many more adventures, many involving food no doubt, but always with her big heart. There'll be bumps in the road where she will discover more about herself and be able to call on the resilience she's developing as a result of her family upbringing and the 'bump's' she's already lived through.                                      I look forward to reading Charlotte's next chapter.","336 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","Reminiscent of Michelle Zauner's                               Crying in H Mart                              and Dolly Alderton's                               Everything I Know About Love                              , Charlotte Ree's                               Heartbake                              is part memoir, part recipe book, and part joyous battle cry for those who find themselves lonely at any age, hungry for so much more from life.

Charlotte Ree's Heartbake was a balm to my food-loving, feeder-tendency soul. It's a celebration of living, loving, and how food can be a marker for life's milestones – this book is a literal feast for one. We get to experience how pivotal food has been for Charlotte, and how that could (or already does) extend to each of us – the power of its life-giving power and of its absence.                                      There were multiple times throughout the book where I would describe Charlotte as a phoenix. To live fully and authentically is to be vulnerable and brave – and Charlotte has both of these qualities in spades, and comes back to life, to live in it and experience it, over and over. How lucky we are that she has laid bare her soul and retold her story so that we can celebrate how far she's come.","336 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 2, 2023","Reminiscent of Michelle Zauner's                               Crying in H Mart                              and Dolly Alderton's                               Everything I Know About Love                              , Charlotte Ree's                               Heartbake                              is part memoir, part recipe book, and part joyous battle cry for those who find themselves lonely at any age, hungry for so much more from life.

With each meal that she masters—a boiled egg, grilled cheese, lasagne, ricotta and pesto ravioli in a brown butter and sage sauce—we follow the story of Charlotte's search for love—in friendship, in family, in romance, and love in herself as she begins to heal from the narratives she'd been telling herself for years.                              Deeply personal and rich with emotion, her prose heart-wrenching, hilarious and hunger-inducing in equal measure, Charlotte explores the complexities of her familial relationships, reflects on how the models she observed affected the love she chose to accept and felt she deserved, recalls both disastrous and delightful dates, and revels in the joy of sharing good food with strangers and significant others alike."

However, it was a really honest and vulnerable account of one Canadian gay man's journey to extricate himself from the cult-like grasp of the Jehovah Witness religion he was raised in. Narrated by the author, this wasn't my favorite as an audiobook. Usually I am all about hearing books read by the authors but in this case I feel like hiring a professional might have served the book better (but that's just my humble opinion). I also felt like the essays were a little disjointed/hard to get fully invested in. Overall I appreciated learning about this very homophobic religion and the author's bravery in turning his back on his upbringing.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","“I spent eighteen years in a group that taught me to hate myself.

He wanted to listen to his true self, but in order to do so he had to build a self. He did it by loving, by reading, traveling, listening, making art, making love, and learning what a friend is. He decided to live with contradiction, amibiguity, and change. He has been shunned by those posing as perfection and so he discarded the facade of perfection. And because he is a true writer who can convey this complexity with grace, his story inspires us to want to know our own contradictions, to see them as riches instead of shame.

2023-07-03,I Felt the End Before It Came: Memoirs of a Queer Ex-Jehovah's Witness,,Daniel Allen Cox,3.69,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'LGBT', 'Audiobook', 'Cults', 'Biography', 'Religion']",Kindle $9.99,Richard Propes,Rating 4 out of 5,"February 27, 2023","It's not surprising that I would resonate deeply with Daniel Allen Cox's intimate and revealing memoir ""I Felt the End Before It Came: Memoirs of a Queer Ex-Jehovah's Witness.""                                      If I were to identify two target groups likely to most appreciate Cox's uncommon candor, it would likely be former JW's who were either disfellowshipped or disassociated and those who identify as LGBTQ and who've experienced and who've experienced some degree of trauma around the journey toward self-acceptance.                                      However, what I really find refreshing about ""I Felt the End Before It Came"" is the lack of polish and sheen that Cox provides. He doesn't sugarcoat himself, his experiences, or his struggles but instead lays it all out there in a rather straightforward manner. While many memoirs leave me feeling like the author has selectively laid out all the best parts and all the juicy parts, Cox simply tells us his story.                                      ""I Felt the End Before It Came"" focuses largely on two significant areas of Cox's life - a childhood spent as a Jehovah's Witness that largely ended around the age 18 when he disassociated himself after being essentially ""outed"" and then vividly (and somewhat hilariously) owning that outing and an adulthood where he’s swept up in a scene of photographers and hustlers blurring the line between art and pornography.                                      Baptized at the age of 13, Cox existed in the cultish world of Jehovah's Witnesses where there's never any question that homosexuality is wrong, holidays and birthdays aren't celebrated because they take the spotlight away from Jehovah, you're advised and counseled by elders with a friendly aura who are watching every move you make and ready to call you out on it, and you've had more than a few traumas from the JW obligation of either going door-to-door or setting up your literature cart in a visible area where you can teach others the truth that leads to eternal life.                                      A casual comment to a trusted friend led to Cox's eventual disassociation from the JW's, a departure that is given surprisingly little time here even if the aftereffect largely dominates the first half of the book as he deals with organizational trauma and the inevitable ""shunning"" from certain family members that is a requirement of the JW's (though he also eloquently points out how some others get around it or just plain refuse it).                                      Having been raised in this environment where traditional societal expectations, for example college, are minimized because they conflict with an absolute commitment to Jehovah, Cox at times feels like he's still processing the experiences as he takes us through his post-JW journey whether that be exploring college, entering the work force, taking up modeling, or learning how to be in relationships and friendships.                                      By now, it's likely evident that I have a personal connection to the material. While I was never baptized as a JW, I was raised in the ""church"" (and I use that term lightly) and was active in all of its activities when my entire life was blown up after sexual abuse from a neighbor was identified by an elder as being ""homosexual"" and I was removed from all church activities. I was infinitely more lucky than Cox in that I wasn't yet baptized (so couldn't really be kicked out) and only my mother was a JW and, as such, I was not shunned by many outside the church. However, as a teen with a disability when all this happened what little social circle I had was gone overnight and it would take me years to sort of find my own path. It would take years to sort out my own identity and to realize that the JW's had, in fact, simply covered up my own abuse in what is now known as a pattern largely perpetuated by elders ill-equipped for the authority they were given.                                      ""I Felt the End Before It Came"" is very much a memoir. If you're hoping for a deep exploration of the Jehovah's Witnesses, look elsewhere. Cox certainly shares his own journey, however, the information provided here is rather fundamental and largely well-known for this group that has always been recognized for its adherence to such practices as door-to-door preaching, not observing holidays, refusing blood transfusions, and the occasional end of the world prediction. Likewise, I never quite felt like I understood Cox's journey toward self-awareness as a young man who identifies as queer and who slowly learns how to embrace this identity and himself.                                      Truthfully, by the end of ""I Felt the End Before It Came"" I didn't really feel like I knew Daniel Allen Cox that well. I appreciated his journey absolutely, however, I felt like there was still a guardedness (understandably) that kept me from really understanding not just his journey but him.                                      ""I Felt the End Before It Came"" is ultimately a powerful story of one man's Armageddon at the hands of a religion that promised salvation but ultimately delivered trauma and destruction. With candor and strong self-awareness, Cox claims his identity and shares his journey largely devoid of histrionics in favor of simple honesty and transparency. It's clear that he's still putting away those long ago teachings, a remarkable testimony to the fact that the lessons we learn in our foundational days linger for years to come.                                      At times remarkably raw and other times almost poetic, ""I Felt the End Before It Came"" may, in fact, be closer to the real truth that leads to eternal life than anything Daniel Allen Cox ever experienced as a child.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","“I spent eighteen years in a group that taught me to hate myself.

My expectations just sort of screwed me a bit here. So yeah, I do think “Essays of a Queer Ex-Jehovah’s Witness” would’ve been a better subtitle.                                      Yes, these essays are memoiric and cover various different points in Cox’s life, these, to me, felt more concerned with ideas and some reflection rather than I guess more traditional memoir storytelling. This wouldn’t have bothered me at all if it weren’t for a few things: a.) I really, really wish there was more use of scene in this collection. It would’ve helped to ground things. b.) not all of these essays really feel ~complete~ to me. There are some that feel like the need some more editing/fine-tuning to have a fully cohesive effect. c.) one or two essays felt like they didn’t quite belong here, which I do think using scene and perhaps even a more linear structure to the essays could’ve really helped with.                                      All that aside, there are some absolutely BANGER lines in this collection that deserve to be read and mulled over. These small moments of brilliance are so, so nice for different reasons. Just makes me wish they didn’t feel like surprises when they did occur.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","“I spent eighteen years in a group that taught me to hate myself.

All opinions are my own.                                      I know very little of Jehovah's Witnesses outside of a few snippets, such as they are the people who proselytize door-to-door, they don't celebrate birthdays, and they are adamantly opposed to LGBTQIA+ people. So going into this, I was curious to hear a first-hand account of what it was like growing up in this environment and then leaving it.                                      Cox does a fantastic job of explaining what it was like to grow up as a JW. He also provides insight into what life was like living as a closeted gay in a very insulated culture that views his sexual orientation as a mortal sin. And when he's outed, he discusses how it's dealt with in JW circles, leaving him completely isolated and alone.                                      But Cox also identifies how JWs operate similarly to a cult, and goes through all of the ways in which they are similar. Leaving the fold sounds like the best thing that has happened to him, as he made his way in the world and listened and learned, essentially deprogramming from all of the harmful beliefs and ways of life that he was indoctrinated into.                                      Narrated by the author, I loved his unvarnished and completely honest style. He talks about his ups and downs, without sugarcoating anything.

A queer boy’s story of escaping the Jehovah's Witnesses. Perhaps I’d relate to leaving religion?                                      I could feel Cox's trauma throughout the book, some subtle, some more blatant--like when his stepfather would beat him up for reading books. Leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses felt like a constant struggle with his identity. At a certain point, he's describing an episode of                                       Watchmen                                      that he saw, where Jehovah’s Witnesses went to carnival grounds on a preaching mission. He says, ""It’s not something we would ever do."" The ""we"" lingers poignantly, as if his identity hasn't completely left the JWs. In comparison, I wondered, would I ever describe how Christians were portrayed and say, ""It's not something we would ever do""? No--I've left the world long ago and Christians are decidedly                                       they                                      to me.                                      Cox's story diverged from my own escape from religion in other ways too: the interplay of his sexual identity with religion and how people perceived him, for example, is unlike my own. Cox lived a more difficult path in that regard. I was surprised when he chose to teach ESL in Poland, a place so notoriously anti-gay that even the author kept to the closet the entire time he lived there.                                      His life further diverged from mine as he described being a porn model in New York City in the mid-90s. During those days I was just turning into a teenager and finding my own sexuality but was worlds apart from the freewheeling ways Cox expressed himself. We were a different generation, but beyond that, I have a hard time relating to that kind of lifestyle.                                      The same goes for polyamory, bathhouses, and drugs--I felt like a prude and naïve reading his book. Maybe reading these pages expands my horizons--but maybe it just didn't connect to me as much as I should have. ""Huh, that's how Jehovah’s Witnesses can affect you,"" I thought. I didn't feel sorry for him, as much as just interested in a portrait of his life.                                      It jumped around too much though. He stuck to themes, but it felt ingenuine at times. I kept wishing he had stuck to one theme longer--his boyhood, or his time in Poland, or his days in New York City, for a deeper dive into the world he built. But instead, it felt like catching up with snippets from a life I didn't know and finding myself more and more distanced from his experience by the end, that he became yet another person in the world, mixed into the background of humanity that I didn't necessarily want to know more about.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","“I spent eighteen years in a group that taught me to hate myself.

I'm always fascinated with people who chose to share their most personal stories for the world to digest, dissect, and judge. Author Daniel Allen Cox shares his story growing up in a very restrictive religion and making a choice to leave. He shares the thoughts, promises, and threats that the Jehovah Witness church ingrains in their people from a very early age. I actually found this part of the book fascinating because I didn't know about all the rules, the do's and don'ts, and what is expected from their followers. I think we are all aware of the refusal of blood transfusions ( which Daniel's mom experienced and almost lost her life) but did you know they are encouraged not to go to college? They believe that the end of the world is near so it makes no sense to waste time and money on an education.                                      Daniel shares his story of being a gay man and leaving JW as a ""Jo Homo"" and how his family members, friends, church goer's are suppose to cut him out completely. He could corrupt them or plant seeds of evil in their heads so the relationship must be severed. Daniel experiences all the emotions and numbs the pain with sex, drugs and alcohol but also discovers himself in the process.                                      I really enjoyed listening to his story and and learning more in depth about a religion I wasn't familiar with.","240 pages, Hardcover                             First published May 9, 2023","“I spent eighteen years in a group that taught me to hate myself.

I knew very little about the Jehovah’s Witnesses, but I didn’t realise are SO cult like, Misogynistic, anti those that identify as LGBTQI and unloving to those that are disfellowed or disassociated . The author was a self proclaimed “JehoHomo” brought up as JW but eventually disassociated after a casual comment about how handsome a female friends boyfriend is. He ends up in NYC where he become a renowned porn model. This doesn’t sugar coat the issue that ex JW suffer from - Gas lighting, shunning, resulting in harm in ways of anger, substance abuse etc. A hard but uplifting story, definitely worth the time to read / listen .

This book speaks to a larger concern of the impact of religion on people's lives, especially for those who identify as LGBTQ+.

As young Mari began to explore her identity as a bisexual, biracial outsider in a rich, white town, Jodie was her constant confidant, even kissing Mari out of the closet. The two were inseparable as they sought to gain a foothold in life and love as young feminists, Jodie an entrepreneurial sex worker, and Mari working in the boys’ club of video game development in the late ‘90s. Then, suddenly and mysteriously, Jodie ends their friendship. Years later, Mari is stunned when she discovers why. Now much older, Mari is ready to forgive, but her memories of Jodie seem to have vanished. Through journal excerpts, letters, conversations with friends, and cross-country travel, she pieces together lost memories from a lost friendship in an attempt at catharsis.

Their deeply personal stories have a way of sticking in my brain. And this book, wow, this book will be with me for awhile. First, it’s beautiful. I do ebooks for most everything but glad I have a real live copy of this one. The colors, the art, the collage format, even the feel of the pages is stunning (can a book be sexy? Sure, why not). I will admit to my digitally conditioned mind getting a little frustrated reading the hand written notes… until I was overcome with my own nostalgia of passing notes to friends and thinking about the notes I still have. The first part of this book sent me on a bit of a flashback to my own teenage years, friends that I no longer have, why friendships end, reading old notes or hearing someone share an old memory that I don’t recall. Memory and perception are interesting and this book really drew that out for me. As the story progressed, I found myself reading faster and faster to find out what happened. Just drawn into the entire story. I don’t finish books this fast. Ever.

They're specific to her life, and full of details. My life is not like hers. My friends are (mostly) not like hers. But the resonance of the relationships in this book, the disorientation and bafflement of a relationship that just ... disappeared, and then drifted out of memory - oof. It hits home.                                      And that's the weird thing. The specificity allows her to write stories that feel visceral and personal, but still feel entirely relatable. Uncomfortably so. Hilariously so. Awkwardly so.                                      Mari takes a lot of risks with how the story is told. It's not so much a comic or a graphic novel as it's just a collage of memories, each conveyed in a way that echos the correct level of detail and linearity for that particular memory.

This book, like some of the others, is a blend of visual and written art: every page incorporates photographs, drawings, or patterned backgrounds that serve as the stage for the written memoir of Mari. Inviting the reader into Mari’s life, a page early in the book states, ‘I will now organize the highlights of my findings as a spelunk through the memorabilia of my past. I do so in an attempt to get clarity and perhaps closure. Bear with me.’ The entertaining and sensitive story is as follows: ‘Jodi was Mari’s best friend through their teens and twenties. As Mari began to explore her identity as a bisexual, biracial outsider in a rich white town Jodie was her constant confidant, even kissing Mari out of the closet. The two were inseparable as they sought to gain a foothold in life and love as young feminists. Suddenly, Jodie ends their friendship. Years later, Mari is stunned when she discovers why.

If one bothers to look, they will find on every page a glimmer of the person who wrote every word on every page. When the book is finished and put on the shelf the reader knows something about the book, and something about the author.                                      In the book, “I Thought You Loved Me,” you will not see a glimmer of the author on every page, as one would expect. Instead, Mari Naomi takes the stage in full living color in a way that makes you break out laughing one moment and crying the next. A talented writer can write a thousand pages and cause us to laugh or cry because of the story. A gifted writer can write a hundred pages and have us laugh or cry because of the author herself/himself.                                      An interesting element in her book is the use of the word, “friend.” A friend to some is a casual relationship. In Mari’s world, a friend is, in a sense tribal. To be her friend is to be invited into her Tribe and with that invitation comes all of the rights, privileges, and responsibilities. It has caused me to rethink my understanding of friend as I like her view of friendship better than mine.                                      Is it a coming of age story? No, and if I thought it was I most likely would not have looked twice at it as we all have a coming of age story. This is the first book I have ever read where the story was subordinate to its author. When she laughed, I laughed, when she cried, I cried, and when others caused her pain, I suffered alongside.

Trigger warning for violence against women, including stalking and rape.)                                      What began as a casual acquaintance eventually blossomed into a best friendship - one that ended seemingly without warning. Mari and Jodie were friends from ages 14 to 28, at which point Jodie abruptly disappeared from Mari's life, leaving Mari to wonder what she did wrong. It would be more than a decade before she learned the truth behind Jodie's exodus, first from mutual contacts and, finally, from her ex-best friend herself.                                      I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME is a sort of excavation - of Mari's friendship with Jodie; the fragile and fleeting nature of memories; coming of age as a biracial, bisexual feminist in the '90s; and building (and losing) relationships and trust - through prose, letters, journal entries, and mixed media collages. It's got a distinct Gen X vibe to it that I love.                                      The mystery of Jodie's departure is, at least to this outsider, so mundane as to be anticlimactic (Of course that was it. OF COURSE.), but the journey leading there is interesting, in a voyeuristic kind of way.                                      That said, I worry that I missed out on some of the nuances of the story. The ARC I received from the publisher was incredibly pixelated; the (charmingly) typewritten index cards proved difficult to read, and anything handwritten - such as Jodie's notes - were plain impossible. The difficult reading experience likely dampened my overall enthusiasm for the book. So, grain of salt.","320 pages, Perfect Paperback                             First published May 3, 2023","Jodie was Mari’s best friend through their teens and twenties.

In their beautifully illustrated and lavishly produced memoir, I Thought You Loved Me, Mari first chronicles the ups and downs of their own romantic life while their friendship with Jodie felt like a true unbreakable bond. As things in Mari's life get messier, Jodie's does too. When Jodie stops communicating with Mari all together, the book gets intensely sad and soul-searching. The mental spiral of lost friendship is characterized with confusion which turns into a strong serving of catty spite after Mari learns of a brutal betrayal.                                      When Mari truly reconnects with Jodie later in the book, you're left feeling a sense of protective dread for Mari.

Told through excerpts from her journal and calendar entries, MariNaomi rediscovers parts of their friendship, both the parts she remembered and parts she had long forgotten. It's an intimate look at a relationship that has changed and shifted over the years, and it's a testament to how our memories can distort the way we look at our past. The artwork itself is unique, and it lends well to the method of storytelling that is used here.                                      From a technical standpoint, as someone with vision issues I did have difficulty reading certain pages based on certain fonts/backgrounds, so that is something to keep in mind.

As young Mari began to explore her identity as a bisexual, biracial outsider in a rich, white town, Jodie was her constant confidant, even kissing Mari out of the closet. The two were inseparable as they sought to gain a foothold in life and love as young feminists, Jodie an entrepreneurial sex worker, and Mari working in the boys’ club of video game development in the late ‘90s. Then, suddenly and mysteriously, Jodie ends their friendship. Years later, Mari is stunned when she discovers why. Now much older, Mari is ready to forgive, but her memories of Jodie seem to have vanished.

I also disagreed on their version of what being a woman is. It seemed like they were pigeon holing women into a very small box of dresses, gossip, sweet smelling moisturises and the thing that really got me angry, when Kneen mentioned the ‘mind-games’ women play.

I felt like with Kneen’s exploration of their gender identity, they felt the need to subtly throw shade at women and I’m not here for that.                                      This seems counterproductive to widening what it means to be a woman and not having such a strict and stereotyped binary.                                      I’m all for people exploring their gender and being who they truly are, but not at the expense of another gender. Especially women.                                      Having said all that, Kneen’s writing is strong and I would definitely read more of their work in the future even if I disagree vehemently with some things they’ve expressed.","320 pages, Paperback                             First published May 2, 2023","How does a person come to know that they are different from the children around them?

The first part of the memoir is a day-by-day retelling of the accident and their long hospital stay. Their experience was tragic and Beth shares her raw and honest emotions as she navigated being a wife, mom and professor during this difficult time. The second and third parts of the memoir are about her husband’s recovery and the challenges they faced as they returned home and learned what life would look like for their family moving forward.                                      I was very emotionally invested in the first part of Deep Waters and I had to stop reading before work a few times because I was so sad for their family! Her writing style hooked me in and I felt like I was listening to her tell about her experience. I think many readers will connect with the way Beth shares about the stress the accident placed on their marriage, but I found these parts to be a little bit long. I enjoyed the details about sailing in Alaska, but didn’t love reading so many details about their arguments and negative feelings. By the end of the memoir, Beth and Jim had learned and grown so much and I love that they were able to look forward to a family sailing trip from Alaska to Mexico. This big trip wasn’t part of the book, but I’m hopeful it was an adventure that only made them stronger.","352 pages, Paperback                             First published May 2, 2023",A marine biologist’s adventurous life as a professor and mother in Alaska is upended when her healthy husband is slammed by a rare type of stroke.

I read her book in three days; I couldn't put it down! It was very well written and gripping. Most memoirs I have found are not in this category. Deep Waters is a real page turner. It drew me in to the scary experience her family faced after her ruggedly strong and fit husband, Jim, had a rare life threatening stroke, that put the brakes on the family's lives and changed their trajectory. I especially loved Beth's descriptions of their nine year old son, Glen, whose buoyant personality helped lighten his parents' spirits and helped them get through the difficult early days after the stroke. After finishing Deep Waters, I was left hanging and wanting to know more. I hope there is a sequel in the works that follows up with their adventures on their sialboat after Beth retires early from her twenty year career as a marine mammalogist upon the urging of her husband and the family heads off on their sailboat into more life adventures.

All to say, when her able-bodied and adventurous husband is beset by a rare stroke, these attributes set the stage for what becomes one of the most challenging episodes in her life. I highly recommend this book to all readers who seek a tale of adventure, love, and relationship mending in the face of daunting challenges.","352 pages, Paperback                             First published May 2, 2023",A marine biologist’s adventurous life as a professor and mother in Alaska is upended when her healthy husband is slammed by a rare type of stroke.

Scientific explanations of what happened are worded simply and are easy to follow. There are a few references to the couple’s marine research projects, but those aren’t the story. The story hooked me on the first page. It’s about relationships – marriage, parenthood, caregiving, friendship, work, and community. Mathews explores each of these roles as she navigates the ups and downs of her husband’s rehab and recovery. It’s a fascinating read for anyone interested in brain function, neuroregeneration, family drama and resilience. It’s also about how their lives are driven by a strong sense of place.","352 pages, Paperback                             First published May 2, 2023",A marine biologist’s adventurous life as a professor and mother in Alaska is upended when her healthy husband is slammed by a rare type of stroke.

In this heartfelt and honest testament of her lie, Mathews details the time before and after her husband suffered from lateral medullary stroke. Her struggle to balance who she is in her career with motherhood and now as a caretaker to her husband had me rooting for her from the very beginning. When her family decides to take Jim’s care in a unique direction, their experiences as a boating family from their home state of Alaska down to Mexico kept me invested from start to finish.

This gorgeous must-read memoir is layered in questions, loss, complexities, wisdom and insightful reflections. I was in awe of how the author managed to navigate some extremely challenging landscapes and yet she was still able to see and experience beauty in the world.                                      What immediately stood out to me was how she notices not only the larger details, but also the smaller ones. I was drawn to how she engages with the world around her. “Moonlight falling on the tangle of blue morning glory in my backyard.”                                      Terra views the world thru poet’s eyes. This is evident thru her stunning use of language. Her use of language is not only beautiful there is also a teaching element woven into it. It invites the reader to consider finding beauty in their own surroundings.                                      In this insightful memoir, the author addresses the power of community, Elders, women and the strong bonds that were created overtime. She also addresses self-acceptance, issues of race and finding her place in the world as a writer and an Elder.                                      Terra’s reflections invite the reader to step inside her world so that they can meet all the amazing people that shaped her as a woman and the brilliant Elder she has become. This book caused me to remember and acknowledge the wealth of wisdom our Ancestors and Elders carry. This is often overlooked in today’s society. Terra and her thoughtful/reflective stories, insights, relationships, and experiences are a strong reminder of how wisdom blossoms with age.                                      My soul felt nourished as I was reading this special memoir and long after I finished it. It has a ripple effect, a way of calling the reader back to her words of wisdom. It’s like an ongoing invitation to go deeper into her insights.                                      I longed for this book to continue. I wanted to linger with these amazing women. It was like drinking sunlight—an elixir for the soul.","230 pages, Paperback                             First published May 1, 2023","We Who Walk the Seven Ways is Terra Trevor’s memoir about seeking healing and finding belonging.

I really enjoyed this memoir and appreciate having a look into the window of Trevor’s soul.                                      American Indian religious practices have often been prohibited by federal laws and government policies. The Indian Removal Act of 1830, The General Allotment Act of 1887 displaced 100s of Native American Tribes from their traditional homelands. Forced assimilation of Native American peoples left them without access to the lands that had traditionally been the sites of other religious ceremonies. Many American Indian children were forced to attend government - or church-operated boarding schools. where children were forbidden to speak their Native languages and forbidden to practice their Native religions, and were mistreated and abused in a myriad of other ways as well. It was not until the 1970’s when Jimmy Carter signed the the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978.                                      This was the world that Trevor was born into. Terra Trevor is a mixed blood Native American who early on passed as white and later on learned to appreciate the value of her Native Traditions.                                      She came from a split home, the daughter of a white woman who was only 16 years her senior, and a Native American man who’s father encouraged those who could to pass as white.She and her white husband adopted a son from Korea as their second child, who died a tragic death in his teens. She knows well the ins and outs of mixed race families on many levels, as well as hiding                                      who she really was in order to get along in life.                                      Later in life she is mentored in the Native American ways by women who were her elders. She learned the importance of Humility, gratitude, respect, caring, compassion, honesty, generosity.                                      Trevor gives us valuable insight into the life she has lived and the life experiences of Native Americans who have gone before her to pave the way.                                      In “We Who Walk the Seven Ways” we are able to walk beside Trevor as she discovers what is really important to her and shows us the importance of being a role model for those who come behnd us.
